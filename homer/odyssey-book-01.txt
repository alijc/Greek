ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:
πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:
αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο
ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10
ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:
τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων
ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15
====================================================
Tell me, Muse, about that wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel.
He saw the towns and came to know the minds of many men,
he endured much grief at sea deep in his soul,
striving to save his own and his comrades' lives and their return to Greece.
But he couldn't rescue his comrades, as much as he would have liked:
for they were destroyed by their own wickedness,
children who ate the bulls of Hyperion Helios:
who robbed them of the day of their return.
Tell us of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, starting wherever you like. 
The others, all who fled utter destruction then,
were home, those who escaped both war and sea:
A lonely man yearning for his home-coming and for his wife,
the nymph Mistress Calypso, the noblest of the goddesses, detained him
in a cavern, longing for him to be her husband.
====================================================

ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν,
τῷ οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι
εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδ᾽ ἔνθα πεφυγμένος ἦεν ἀέθλων
καὶ μετὰ οἷσι φίλοισι. θεοὶ δ᾽ ἐλέαιρον ἅπαντες
νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος: ὁ δ᾽ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν    20
ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι πάρος ἣν γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι.
ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν Αἰθίοπας μετεκίαθε τηλόθ᾽ ἐόντας,
Αἰθίοπας τοὶ διχθὰ δεδαίαται, ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν,
οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος οἱ δ᾽ ἀνιόντος,
ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης.    25
ἔνθ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐτέρπετο δαιτὶ παρήμενος: οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι
Ζηνὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀλυμπίου ἁθρόοι ἦσαν.
τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε:
μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Αἰγίσθοιο,
τόν ῥ᾽ Ἀγαμεμνονίδης τηλεκλυτὸς ἔκταν᾽ Ὀρέστης:    30
====================================================

But indeed as time rolled on there came a year
when the gods fated that he go home
to Ithica, but even after he made it there he still struggled,
even among his loved ones.  All the gods took pity on him
except Poseidon: he raged unceasingly against
godlike Odysseus until he came to his own land.
But he was visiting the far off Ethiopians,
the most distant of men, split in two parts,
some where Hyperion sinks and some where it rises,
going there to receive an offering of a hundred each of bulls and rams.
He enjoyed himself there, sitting at the feast: while the others
crowded together in Olympian Zeus' great halls.
The father of men and of gods was first to speak to them:
for deep in his soul he was minded of noble Aigisthos,
whom Agamemnon's son, the far-famed Orestes, had killed:
====================================================

τοῦ ὅ γ᾽ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπε᾽ ἀθανάτοισι μετηύδα:
‘ὢ πόποι, οἷον δή νυ θεοὺς βροτοὶ αἰτιόωνται:

ἐξ ἡμέων γάρ φασι κάκ᾽ ἔμμεναι, οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ
σφῇσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὑπὲρ μόρον ἄλγε᾽ ἔχουσιν,

ὡς καὶ νῦν Αἴγισθος ὑπὲρ μόρον Ἀτρεΐδαο    35
γῆμ᾽ ἄλοχον μνηστήν, τὸν δ᾽ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα,

εἰδὼς αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἐπεὶ πρό οἱ εἴπομεν ἡμεῖς,
Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες, ἐύσκοπον ἀργεϊφόντην,

μήτ᾽ αὐτὸν κτείνειν μήτε μνάασθαι ἄκοιτιν:
ἐκ γὰρ Ὀρέσταο τίσις ἔσσεται Ἀτρεΐδαο,    40

ὁππότ᾽ ἂν ἡβήσῃ τε καὶ ἧς ἱμείρεται αἴης.
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽ Ἑρμείας, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ φρένας Αἰγίσθοιο

πεῖθ᾽ ἀγαθὰ φρονέων: νῦν δ᾽ ἁθρόα πάντ᾽ ἀπέτισεν.’
====================================================
AJC
And he was remembering this when he addressed the Immortals:
"Oh shame, what mortals now blame the gods for:

for they say that evil comes from us, to him and they
from their own wickedness they bear travails beyond fate,

as even now Aigisthos beyond the fate of Atreus' son
bedded with a wedded wife, and slew her man on his return,

having known utter ruin, when we ourselves spoke to him before,
having sent Hermes, the keen-sighted slayer of Argus,

neither to slay him nor to woo his wife:
for from Orestes, the son of Atreus, to vengeance to be going to be,

when he might have both attained and desired her earth.
as Hermes said, but not >the heart of Atreus' son

he persuaded, minded of good things: he now repaid it all together."
