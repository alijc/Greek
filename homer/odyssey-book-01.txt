ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:
πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:
αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο
ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10
ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:
τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων
ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15
====================================================
Tell me, Muse, about that wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel.
He saw the towns and came to know the minds of many men,
he endured much grief at sea deep in his soul,
striving to save his own and his comrades' lives and their return to Greece.
But he couldn't rescue his comrades, as much as he would have liked:
for they were destroyed by their own wickedness,
children who ate the bulls of Hyperion Helios:
who robbed them of the day of their return.
Tell us of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, starting wherever you like. 
The others, all who fled utter destruction then,
were home, those who escaped both war and sea:
A lonely man yearning for his home-coming and for his wife,
the nymph Mistress Calypso, the noblest of the goddesses, detained him
in a cavern, longing for him to be her husband.
====================================================

ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν,
τῷ οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι
εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδ᾽ ἔνθα πεφυγμένος ἦεν ἀέθλων
καὶ μετὰ οἷσι φίλοισι. θεοὶ δ᾽ ἐλέαιρον ἅπαντες
νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος: ὁ δ᾽ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν    20
ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι πάρος ἣν γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι.
ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν Αἰθίοπας μετεκίαθε τηλόθ᾽ ἐόντας,
Αἰθίοπας τοὶ διχθὰ δεδαίαται, ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν,
οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος οἱ δ᾽ ἀνιόντος,
ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης.    25
ἔνθ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐτέρπετο δαιτὶ παρήμενος: οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι
Ζηνὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀλυμπίου ἁθρόοι ἦσαν.
τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε:
μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Αἰγίσθοιο,
τόν ῥ᾽ Ἀγαμεμνονίδης τηλεκλυτὸς ἔκταν᾽ Ὀρέστης:    30
====================================================

But indeed as time rolled on there came a year
when the gods fated that he go home
to Ithica, but even after he made it there he still struggled,
even among his loved ones.  All the gods took pity on him
except Poseidon: he raged unceasingly against
godlike Odysseus until he came to his own land.
But he was visiting the far off Ethiopians,
the most distant of men, split in two parts,
some where Hyperion sinks and some where it rises,
going there to receive an offering of a hundred each of bulls and rams.
He enjoyed himself there, sitting at the feast: while the others
crowded together in Olympian Zeus' great halls.
The father of men and of gods was first to speak to them:
for deep in his soul he was minded of noble Aigisthos,
whom Agamemnon's son, the far-famed Orestes, had killed:
====================================================

τοῦ ὅ γ᾽ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπε᾽ ἀθανάτοισι μετηύδα:
‘ὢ πόποι, οἷον δή νυ θεοὺς βροτοὶ αἰτιόωνται:
ἐξ ἡμέων γάρ φασι κάκ᾽ ἔμμεναι, οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ
σφῇσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὑπὲρ μόρον ἄλγε᾽ ἔχουσιν,
ὡς καὶ νῦν Αἴγισθος ὑπὲρ μόρον Ἀτρεΐδαο    35
γῆμ᾽ ἄλοχον μνηστήν, τὸν δ᾽ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα,
εἰδὼς αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἐπεὶ πρό οἱ εἴπομεν ἡμεῖς,
Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες, ἐύσκοπον ἀργεϊφόντην,
μήτ᾽ αὐτὸν κτείνειν μήτε μνάασθαι ἄκοιτιν:
ἐκ γὰρ Ὀρέσταο τίσις ἔσσεται Ἀτρεΐδαο,    40
ὁππότ᾽ ἂν ἡβήσῃ τε καὶ ἧς ἱμείρεται αἴης.
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽ Ἑρμείας, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ φρένας Αἰγίσθοιο
πεῖθ᾽ ἀγαθὰ φρονέων: νῦν δ᾽ ἁθρόα πάντ᾽ ἀπέτισεν.’
====================================================
And he was thinking of him when he addressed the Immortals:
"Oh shame, how mortals now blame the gods:
for they say that evil comes from us, while they
of their own fault bear sufferings due to their own wickedness,
as even now Aigisthos sealed his fate by bedding Agamemnon's
wedded wife, and slaying him on his return,
despite knowing it was his ruin, since beforehand we ourselves
sent Hermes, the keen-sighted slayer of Argus, to tell him
to neither slay him nor to woo his wife:
for from Orestes would come vengeance for Atreus' son
when he had grown up and longed for his land.
Hermes said this, but Aigisthos' heart was not persuaded,
minded of good things: now he paid for it all in full."
====================================================
τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:
‘ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων,    45
καὶ λίην κεῖνός γε ἐοικότι κεῖται ὀλέθρῳ:
ὡς ἀπόλοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι:
ἀλλά μοι ἀμφ᾽ Ὀδυσῆι δαΐφρονι δαίεται ἦτορ,
δυσμόρῳ, ὃς δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχει
νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ, ὅθι τ᾽ ὀμφαλός ἐστι θαλάσσης.    50
νῆσος δενδρήεσσα, θεὰ δ᾽ ἐν δώματα ναίει,
Ἄτλαντος θυγάτηρ ὀλοόφρονος, ὅς τε θαλάσσης
πάσης βένθεα οἶδεν, ἔχει δέ τε κίονας αὐτὸς
μακράς, αἳ γαῖάν τε καὶ οὐρανὸν ἀμφὶς ἔχουσιν.
τοῦ θυγάτηρ δύστηνον ὀδυρόμενον κατερύκει,    55
αἰεὶ δὲ μαλακοῖσι καὶ αἱμυλίοισι λόγοισιν

ἧς γαίης, θανέειν ἱμείρεται. οὐδέ νυ σοί περ
ἐντρέπεται φίλον ἦτορ, Ὀλύμπιε. οὔ νύ τ᾽ Ὀδυσσεὺς   60

Τροίῃ ἐν εὐρείῃ; τί νύ οἱ τόσον ὠδύσαο, Ζεῦ;’
========================================
Then the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, answered him:
"Our father, the son of Cronos, the highest of lords,
indeed that man sprawls in a fitting destruction:
and may anyone who does such things as these be destroyed as well:
but my heart is torn for ill-fated warlike Odysseus,
who suffers from calamities, so far from his friends,
on a sea-girt island, the navel of the sea.
A wooded island, in a house there dwells a goddess,
the daughter of baleful Atlas, who knows the depths
of the whole sea, and who holds the tall pillars
that hold the earth and sky apart.
His daughter detains the wretched mournful man,
ever with soft and fawning words she beguiles him,
to make him forget Ithaca: nevertheless Odysseus
longing to see even the smoke rising
from his homeland, wishes to die.  Your dear heart doesn't yet
feel misgivings, Olympian. Was not Odysseus of Argos
willingly performing sacrifices beside his ships
in far-spread Troy?  What do you now hate in him so greatly, Zeus?"
========================================
τὴν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς:
‘τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων.
πῶς ἂν ἔπειτ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ θείοιο λαθοίμην,   65
ὃς περὶ μὲν νόον ἐστὶ βροτῶν, περὶ δ᾽ ἱρὰ θεοῖσιν
ἀθανάτοισιν ἔδωκε, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν;
ἀλλὰ Ποσειδάων γαιήοχος ἀσκελὲς αἰεὶ
Κύκλωπος κεχόλωται, ὃν ὀφθαλμοῦ ἀλάωσεν,
ἀντίθεον Πολύφημον, ὅου κράτος ἐστὶ μέγιστον   70
πᾶσιν Κυκλώπεσσι: Θόωσα δέ μιν τέκε νύμφη,
Φόρκυνος θυγάτηρ ἁλὸς ἀτρυγέτοιο μέδοντος,
ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι Ποσειδάωνι μιγεῖσα.
ἐκ τοῦ δὴ Ὀδυσῆα Ποσειδάων ἐνοσίχθων
οὔ τι κατακτείνει, πλάζει δ᾽ ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης.   75
ἀλλ᾽ ἄγεθ᾽, ἡμεῖς οἵδε περιφραζώμεθα πάντες
νόστον, ὅπως ἔλθῃσι: Ποσειδάων δὲ μεθήσει
ὃν χόλον: οὐ μὲν γὰρ τι δυνήσεται ἀντία πάντων
ἀθανάτων ἀέκητι θεῶν ἐριδαινέμεν οἶος.’
========================================
Answering her, Zeus the cloud-gatherer said:
"My child, what a speech has escaped your wall of teeth.
How could I forget the godlike Odysseus,
he who is above mortals in resolve, who offered more than a priest
to the immortal gods, who inhabit the broad heavens?
But earth-carrying Poseidon was unceasingly
angered about the Cyclops whom he blinded,
godlike Polyphemus, whose strength is greater
than all other Cyclopses - the nymph Thoosa bore him,
the daughter of Phorcys, the ruler of the barren sea -
she'd been shagged by Poseidon in hollow caves.
Indeed, from that time the earth-shaker Poseidon did not
kill Odysseus, but he turned him away from his father's land.
But come now!  Let all of us here think on 
his home-coming, how he might arrive; and Poseidon will let go
of his wrath; for he won't be strong enough to contend alone
against against the will of all the immortal gods."
========================================

τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:   80
‘ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων,

εἰ μὲν δὴ νῦν τοῦτο φίλον μακάρεσσι θεοῖσιν,
νοστῆσαι Ὀδυσῆα πολύφρονα ὅνδε δόμονδε,

Ἑρμείαν μὲν ἔπειτα διάκτορον ἀργεϊφόντην

.. νόστον πευσόμενον πατρὸς φίλου, ἤν που ἀκούσῃ,
ἠδ᾽ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν.’
========================================

Then the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, answered him:
"O father, son of Cronos, our highest lord,

if we just now encouraged this man, beloved by the blessed gods,
that wily Odysseus, to return home,

and then the messenger Hermes, the slayer of Argus,
to the isle of Ogygia, to swiftly 

tell his fair-haired bride the sure decree,
the home-coming of stout-hearted Odysseus, as he might come:

but I'll go to Ithaca myself, to get his son
all riled up and put a purpose in his heart,

after he summons heads, the long-haired Achaeans into the market-place
to speak to all the suitors, both they to him always

>thick apples they slay and to sandy Pylos
>home-coming will learn of beloved father, and if only

there they might have his good report in men.
