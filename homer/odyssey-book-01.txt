ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:

πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,

ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:

αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο

ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10

ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:

τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων

ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15

AJC
Tell me, Muse, about that wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel:

AJC
he saw the towns of many men and came to know their minds,
he endured much grief at sea throughout his life,

AJC
after winning both his life and his comrades-in-arms' return to Greece.
But he didn't yet draw his comrades to him thus, eager as he was:

AJC
for they were destroyed by their own wickedness,
children, who according to bulls of Hyperion Helios

AJC
were eating: nevertheless he was taken away by them on the day of his return.
Somewhere the goddess, the daughter of Zeus, also told us of them.

AJC
All the others there, however far they fled utter destruction,
were at home, those who fled both war and sea:

AJC
>the lonely man yearning for his home-coming and for his wife
the bride queen Calypso detained him because of goddesses

AJC
in hollow grottoes, longing for him to be her husband.
