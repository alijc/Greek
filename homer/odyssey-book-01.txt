ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:

πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,

ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:

αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο

ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10

ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:

.. τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων

.. ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15

AJC
Tell me, Muse, of a wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel:

AJC
he saw towns of many men and came to know their minds,
he endured much grief at sea throughout his life,

AJC
after winning both his life and his companions' home-coming.
but in no wise as he drew his companions to him, however eager:

AJC
for of them by their own wickedness were destroyed,
children, they according to bulls of Hyperion Sun

AJC
were eating: nevertheless he was taken away by them in the day.
somewhere the goddess, the daughter of Zeus, also told us of them.

AJC
there all others, however far they fled utter destruction,
were at home, those who fled both war and sea:

AJC
>the lone man of home-coming having been proclaimed (by oracle) and of woman
bride mistress/queen Calypso curbed because of goddesses

AJC
in hollow grottoes, longing for him to be her husband.
