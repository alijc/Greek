ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:
πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:
αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο
ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10
ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:
τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων
ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15
====================================================
Tell me, Muse, about that wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel.
He saw the towns and came to know the minds of many men,
he endured much grief at sea deep in his soul,
striving to save his own and his comrades' lives and their return to Greece.
But he couldn't rescue his comrades, as much as he would have liked:
for they were destroyed by their own wickedness,
children who ate the bulls of Hyperion Helios:
who robbed them of the day of their return.
Tell us of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, starting wherever you like. 
The others, all who fled utter destruction then,
were home, those who escaped both war and sea:
A lonely man yearning for his home-coming and for his wife,
the nymph Mistress Calypso, the noblest of the goddesses, detained him
in a cavern, longing for him to be her husband.
====================================================

ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν,
τῷ οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι

εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδ᾽ ἔνθα πεφυγμένος ἦεν ἀέθλων
καὶ μετὰ οἷσι φίλοισι. θεοὶ δ᾽ ἐλέαιρον ἅπαντες

νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος: ὁ δ᾽ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν    20
ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι πάρος ἣν γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι.

ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν Αἰθίοπας μετεκίαθε τηλόθ᾽ ἐόντας,
Αἰθίοπας τοὶ διχθὰ δεδαίαται, ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν,

οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος οἱ δ᾽ ἀνιόντος,
ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης.    25

ἔνθ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐτέρπετο δαιτὶ παρήμενος: οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι
Ζηνὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀλυμπίου ἁθρόοι ἦσαν.

τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε:
μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Αἰγίσθοιο,

.. τόν ῥ᾽ Ἀγαμεμνονίδης τηλεκλυτὸς ἔκταν᾽ Ὀρέστης:    30


AJC But indeed when a year came as the time rolled on,
the fates destined them to go home

AJC to Ithica, not yet there he who fled was contending with
and among their loved ones.  All the gods took pity

AJC except Poseidon: he hotly raged against
godlike Odysseus formerly >the land to come.

AJC but he was following those being Ethiopians from after
they divided the Ethiopians, uttermost of men, in twain,

AJC they of Hyperion who will sink they he who rises
he who goes to meet both of bulls and of rams of offering 100.

AJC there he was cheered ??? ???: indeed the others
of Zeus in halls of Olympus in crowds were.

AJC to them of stories the father of men and of gods led/was first:
for he was reminded/reminded himself deep in his soul of noble Aiyisthos,

AJC >him ? Agamemnon's son of horses Orestes killed:
