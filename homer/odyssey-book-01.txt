ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:

πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,

ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:

αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο

ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10

ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:

τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων

ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15

Tell me, Muse, about that wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel.

He saw the towns and came to know the minds of many men,
he endured much grief at sea throughout his life,

striving to save his own and his comrades' lives and their return to Greece.
But he couldn't rescue his comrades, as much as he would have liked:

for they were destroyed by their own wickedness,
children who ate the bulls of Hyperion Helios:

who barred from them the day of their return.
Tell us, goddess, daughter of Zeus, something also of them. 

The others, all who fled utter destruction there,
were home, those who escaped both war and sea:

A lonely man yearning for his home-coming and for his wife,
the nymph Mistress Calypso detained him with goddesses

in a cavern, longing for him to be her husband.
