ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:
πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:
αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο
ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10
ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:
τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων
ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15
====================================================
Tell me, Muse, about that wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel.
He saw the towns and came to know the minds of many men,
he endured much grief at sea deep in his soul,
striving to save his own and his comrades' lives and their return to Greece.
But he couldn't rescue his comrades, as much as he would have liked:
for they were destroyed by their own wickedness,
children who ate the bulls of Hyperion Helios:
who robbed them of the day of their return.
Tell us of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, starting wherever you like. 
The others, all who fled utter destruction then,
were home, those who escaped both war and sea:
A lonely man yearning for his home-coming and for his wife,
the nymph Mistress Calypso, the noblest of the goddesses, detained him
in a cavern, longing for him to be her husband.
====================================================

ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν,
τῷ οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι
εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδ᾽ ἔνθα πεφυγμένος ἦεν ἀέθλων
καὶ μετὰ οἷσι φίλοισι. θεοὶ δ᾽ ἐλέαιρον ἅπαντες
νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος: ὁ δ᾽ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν    20
ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι πάρος ἣν γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι.
ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν Αἰθίοπας μετεκίαθε τηλόθ᾽ ἐόντας,
Αἰθίοπας τοὶ διχθὰ δεδαίαται, ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν,
οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος οἱ δ᾽ ἀνιόντος,
ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης.    25
ἔνθ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐτέρπετο δαιτὶ παρήμενος: οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι
Ζηνὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀλυμπίου ἁθρόοι ἦσαν.
τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε:
μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Αἰγίσθοιο,
τόν ῥ᾽ Ἀγαμεμνονίδης τηλεκλυτὸς ἔκταν᾽ Ὀρέστης:    30
====================================================

But indeed as time rolled on there came a year
when the gods fated that he go home
to Ithica, but even after he made it there he still struggled,
even among his loved ones.  All the gods took pity on him
except Poseidon: he raged unceasingly against
godlike Odysseus until he came to his own land.
But he was visiting the far off Ethiopians,
the most distant of men, split in two parts,
some where Hyperion sinks and some where it rises,
going there to receive an offering of a hundred each of bulls and rams.
He enjoyed himself there, sitting at the feast: while the others
crowded together in Olympian Zeus' great halls.
The father of men and of gods was first to speak to them:
for deep in his soul he was minded of noble Aigisthos,
whom Agamemnon's son, the far-famed Orestes, had killed:
====================================================

τοῦ ὅ γ᾽ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπε᾽ ἀθανάτοισι μετηύδα:
‘ὢ πόποι, οἷον δή νυ θεοὺς βροτοὶ αἰτιόωνται:
ἐξ ἡμέων γάρ φασι κάκ᾽ ἔμμεναι, οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ
σφῇσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὑπὲρ μόρον ἄλγε᾽ ἔχουσιν,
ὡς καὶ νῦν Αἴγισθος ὑπὲρ μόρον Ἀτρεΐδαο    35
γῆμ᾽ ἄλοχον μνηστήν, τὸν δ᾽ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα,
εἰδὼς αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἐπεὶ πρό οἱ εἴπομεν ἡμεῖς,
Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες, ἐύσκοπον ἀργεϊφόντην,
μήτ᾽ αὐτὸν κτείνειν μήτε μνάασθαι ἄκοιτιν:
ἐκ γὰρ Ὀρέσταο τίσις ἔσσεται Ἀτρεΐδαο,    40
ὁππότ᾽ ἂν ἡβήσῃ τε καὶ ἧς ἱμείρεται αἴης.
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽ Ἑρμείας, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ φρένας Αἰγίσθοιο
πεῖθ᾽ ἀγαθὰ φρονέων: νῦν δ᾽ ἁθρόα πάντ᾽ ἀπέτισεν.’
====================================================
And he was thinking of him when he addressed the Immortals:
"Oh shame, how mortals now blame the gods:
for they say that evil comes from us, while they
of their own fault bear sufferings due to their own wickedness,
as even now Aigisthos sealed his fate by bedding Agamemnon's
wedded wife, and slaying him on his return,
despite knowing it was his ruin, since beforehand we ourselves
sent Hermes, the keen-sighted slayer of Argus, to tell him
to neither slay him nor to woo his wife:
for from Orestes would come vengeance for Atreus' son
when he had grown up and longed for his land.
Hermes said this, but Aigisthos' heart was not persuaded,
minded of good things: now he paid for it all in full."
====================================================
τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:
‘ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων,    45
καὶ λίην κεῖνός γε ἐοικότι κεῖται ὀλέθρῳ:
ὡς ἀπόλοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι:
ἀλλά μοι ἀμφ᾽ Ὀδυσῆι δαΐφρονι δαίεται ἦτορ,
δυσμόρῳ, ὃς δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχει

αἰεὶ δὲ μαλακοῖσι καὶ αἱμυλίοισι λόγοισιν

========================================
Then the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, answered him:
"Our father, the son of Cronos, the highest of lords,
indeed that man sprawls in a fitting destruction:
and may anyone who does such things as these be destroyed as well:
but my heart is torn for ill-fated warlike Odysseus,
who suffers from calamities, so far from his friends,
on a sea-girt island, the navel of the sea.
A wooded island, in a house there dwells a goddess,
the daughter of baleful Atlas, who knows the depths
of the whole sea, and who holds the tall pillars
that hold the earth and sky apart.
His daughter detains the wretched mournful man,
ever with soft and fawning words she beguiles him,
to make him forget Ithaca: nevertheless Odysseus
longing to see even the smoke rising
from his homeland, wishes to die.  Your dear heart doesn't yet
feel misgivings, Olympian. Was not Odysseus of Argos
willingly performing sacrifices beside his ships
in far-spread Troy?  What do you now hate in him so greatly, Zeus?"
========================================
τὴν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς:
‘τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων.
πῶς ἂν ἔπειτ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ θείοιο λαθοίμην,   65
ὃς περὶ μὲν νόον ἐστὶ βροτῶν, περὶ δ᾽ ἱρὰ θεοῖσιν
ἀθανάτοισιν ἔδωκε, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν;
ἀλλὰ Ποσειδάων γαιήοχος ἀσκελὲς αἰεὶ

ἀλλ᾽ ἄγεθ᾽, ἡμεῖς οἵδε περιφραζώμεθα πάντες

ὃν χόλον: οὐ μὲν γὰρ τι δυνήσεται ἀντία πάντων
ἀθανάτων ἀέκητι θεῶν ἐριδαινέμεν οἶος.’
========================================
Answering her, Zeus the cloud-gatherer said:
"My child, what a speech has escaped your wall of teeth.
How could I forget the godlike Odysseus,
he who is above mortals in resolve, who offered more than a priest
to the immortal gods, who inhabit the broad heavens?
But earth-carrying Poseidon was unceasingly
angered about the Cyclops whom he blinded,
godlike Polyphemus, whose strength is greater
than all other Cyclopses - the nymph Thoosa bore him,
the daughter of Phorcys, the ruler of the barren sea -
she'd been shagged by Poseidon in hollow caves.
Indeed, from that time the earth-shaker Poseidon did not
kill Odysseus, but he turned him away from his father's land.
But come now!  Let all of us here think on 
his home-coming, how he might arrive; and Poseidon will let go
of his wrath; for he won't be strong enough to contend alone
against against the will of all the immortal gods."
========================================

τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:   80
‘ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων,

ἠδ᾽ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν.’
========================================

Then the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, answered him:
"O father, son of Cronos, our highest lord,
if this truly is welcome to the blessed gods,
that wily Odysseus should return to his home,
then let us speed the messenger Hermes, the slayer of Argus,
to the isle of Ogygia, to promptly
tell the fair-haired nymph the final judgment,
the home-coming of stout-hearted Odysseus, that he should return home:
but I'll go to Ithaca myself, to get his son
all riled up and put purpose in his heart,
to summon the people, the long-haired Achaeans, into the market-place
and to speak to all the suitors, who are always slaughtering
his thronging sheep and his lumbering crimped-horned oxen.
and I'll send him to both Sparta and to sandy Pylos -
to ask about the return of his dear father, and if he should hear anything,
may he there have his good report among men."
========================================

ὣς εἰποῦσ᾽ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα,
ἀμβρόσια χρύσεια, τά μιν φέρον ἠμὲν ἐφ᾽ ὑγρὴν
ἠδ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν ἅμα πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο:

========================================

After she said this she bound her feet in beautiful sandals,
divine and golden, which would carry her upon both sea
and boundless earth, swift as a blast of wind:
she grasped a stout spear, tipped with sharp bronze,
large, heavy, and sturdy, with which she subdues the ranks of any hero-men
that this daughter of a mighty sire might be angry with.
She darted out and stepped down from Olympus' peaks,
and came to a stop in the land of Ithaca at Odysseus' door,
at the threshold of his courtyard; in her hand she carried her spear of bronze,
appearing as a stranger, Mentes, the king of the Taphians.
And there she found the arrogant suitors. They were
cheering their spirits, playing checkers in front of the doors
sitting on the hides of oxen that they themselves had killed;
And their heralds and their busy servants,
some were mixing wine and water in bowls
while some washed the tables with porous sponges
and set them, and some distributed much meat.
========================================
τὴν δὲ πολὺ πρῶτος ἴδε Τηλέμαχος θεοειδής,
ἧστο γὰρ ἐν μνηστῆρσι φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ,

καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:
‘χαῖρε, ξεῖνε, παρ᾽ ἄμμι φιλήσεαι: αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα

ὣς εἰπὼν ἡγεῖθ᾽, ἡ δ᾽ ἕσπετο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη.   125
οἱ δ᾽ ὅτε δή ῥ᾽ ἔντοσθεν ἔσαν δόμου ὑψηλοῖο,

ἔγχε᾽ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἵστατο πολλά,
αὐτὴν δ᾽ ἐς θρόνον εἷσεν ἄγων, ὑπὸ λῖτα πετάσσας,   130
καλὸν δαιδάλεον: ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν.
========================================

The godlike Telemachus was by far the first to see her,
for he'd sat among the suitors, grieving in his dear heart,
seeing his brave father in his minds eye, if only he'd come from somewhere
and send the suitors scattering from the house,
he'd have honor and be master over his own house.
Minded of this, while he sat with the suitors, he saw Athena.
he walked straight to the doorway, ashamed in his soul
that a stranger had waited so long at the door: he stopped beside her,
grasped her right hand and took the bronze spear,
and addressed her, uttering winged words:
"Greetings, stranger, you're welcome in our house: and when
you've had some dinner you'll tell of what you need."
When he'd spoken thus he led the way, and Pallas Athena followed.
As soon as they were inside the lofty house,
he stood the spear that he was carrying in a spear-case
of polished metal near a tall pillar, where many 
other spears of stout-hearted Odysseus stood.
He led her to a chair and seated her, spreading a linen cloth beneath,
the chair was beautifully wrought: with a footstool for her feet under it.
========================================

πὰρ δ᾽ αὐτὸς κλισμὸν θέτο ποικίλον, ἔκτοθεν ἄλλων
μνηστήρων, μὴ ξεῖνος ἀνιηθεὶς ὀρυμαγδῷ

ἠδ᾽ ἵνα μιν περὶ πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο ἔροιτο.   135

τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν,
σῖτον δὲ δμῳαὶ παρενήνεον ἐν κανέοισιν,
========================================

He himself sat on an inlaid couch beside her, far from
the suitors, lest his guest should loathe the meal,
bothered by the din of the proud boys who had come,
and to let him ask about his absent father.
A handmaiden brought water in an elegant gold ewer
and poured it out over a silver basin for washing their hands,
and set out a planed table beside them.
The respectable housekeeper brought bread and set it before them.
She set many dishes down, giving freely of what she had.
The carver picked up trenchers of all sorts of meats and set them down.
He set golden goblets by their side, while
a herald often came up to them, pouring out wine.
The arrogant suitors came in, and then 
sat down, one after the other, on the couches and chairs.
Heralds poured water over their hands,
handmaidens heaped bread into baskets,
and boys filled drinking vessels.
========================================
οἱ δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ὀνείαθ᾽ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον.

========================================
They put their hands out to the food that had been cooked and set before them.
After the suitors had sated themselves on food and drink,
they turned their hearts to other things,
to song and dance: for these are a banquet's delights:
a herald placed a beautiful lyre into Phemius' hands,
who was forced to sing for the suitors.
And he took the harp and struck up a beautiful song.
But Telemachus addressed Athena of the gleaming eyes,
holding his head close, for fear the others might notice:
"Dear stranger, will you be mad at me for what I say?
These men care for these things, playing the lyre and singing,
lightly, while they, without recompense, eat up the livelihood of another man,
whose bleached bones are decaying somewhere, lying on the ground
in the rain, or rolled by the waves in the sea.
========================================
εἰ κεῖνόν γ᾽ Ἰθάκηνδε ἰδοίατο νοστήσαντα,

========================================
If they should see that man on his way to Ithaca,
they'd all pray to be lighter on their feet 
rather than richer in gold and clothing.
But now he has thus been foully doomed to die, and with
no comfort for us, even if any man on earth
should say that he will come: the day of his home-coming is lost.
But come, tell me this and recount it truly:
Who are you among men, and from where? Where is your city and your parents?
And what sort of ship did you arrive on: How did the sailors
bring you to Ithaca?  Who did they profess to be?
For I don't think that you came here on foot.
Tell me this truly, so that I might know it well,
are you just now visiting, or are you my father's friend,
since many others have been coming to our house,
since he also was wandering in the world of men."
========================================

========================================

And the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, spoke to him again:
"Well then, I will tell you these things with absolute exactness.
I declare that I am Mentes, the son of warlike Anchialus,
and I am lord to the Taphians, who are fond of the oar.
So I have now come with a ship and my companions,
sailing on the wine-colored sea to where men talk strangely,
I carry glittering iron to Temese, looking for copper.
My ship has put in by a field far from town,
in Reithron Harbor, under the woods of Neion.
I proclaim that we are friends, as our families have been
from the start. If you were to go and ask the old hero Leartes,
whom (they say) no longer sets out for town,
but endures miseries far away in the country
with an old waiting-woman. She serves him both meat and drink
whenever weariness takes hold of his limbs,
as he creeps up the slope of his vinyard.
========================================
νῦν δ᾽ ἦλθον: δὴ γάρ μιν ἔφαντ᾽ ἐπιδήμιον εἶναι,
σὸν πατέρ᾽: ἀλλά νυ τόν γε θεοὶ βλάπτουσι κελεύθου.   195
οὐ γάρ πω τέθνηκεν ἐπὶ χθονὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
ἀλλ᾽ ἔτι που ζωὸς κατερύκεται εὐρέι πόντῳ
νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ, χαλεποὶ δέ μιν ἄνδρες ἔχουσιν
ἄγριοι, οἵ που κεῖνον ἐρυκανόωσ᾽ ἀέκοντα.
αὐτὰρ νῦν τοι ἐγὼ μαντεύσομαι, ὡς ἐνὶ θυμῷ   200
ἀθάνατοι βάλλουσι καὶ ὡς τελέεσθαι ὀίω,
οὔτε τι μάντις ἐὼν οὔτ᾽ οἰωνῶν σάφα εἰδώς.
οὔ τοι ἔτι δηρόν γε φίλης ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης
ἔσσεται, οὐδ᾽ εἴ πέρ τε σιδήρεα δέσματ᾽ ἔχῃσιν:
φράσσεται ὥς κε νέηται, ἐπεὶ πολυμήχανός ἐστιν.   205
ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον,
εἰ δὴ ἐξ αὐτοῖο τόσος πάϊς εἰς Ὀδυσῆος.
========================================

Now I have come: for indeed they said that he was at home,
your father, that is.  But now the gods are blocking his journey.
For the illustrious Odysseus has not yet died upon the earth,
but still lives somewhere. He is detained on a seagirt island
by the wide sea, fierce, savage men hold him back,
they, I think, restrain that unwilling man.
Nevertheless I'll now prophesy to you, as the immortals
cast in my heart and as I think it will come about,
though I am not a seer, nor do I know the truth of auguries.
Not much longer will he be away from you and from his beloved fatherland,
not even if iron fetters should hold him -
he'll think up a way to get here, since he's a wily one.
But come, tell me this, and truthfully recount,
if indeed, being so tall, you yourself are Odysseus' son.
========================================
αἰνῶς μὲν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὄμματα καλὰ ἔοικας
κείνῳ, ἐπεὶ θαμὰ τοῖον ἐμισγόμεθ᾽ ἀλλήλοισιν,
πρίν γε τὸν ἐς Τροίην ἀναβήμεναι, ἔνθα περ ἄλλοι   210
Ἀργείων οἱ ἄριστοι ἔβαν κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσίν:
ἐκ τοῦ δ᾽ οὔτ᾽ Ὀδυσῆα ἐγὼν ἴδον οὔτ᾽ ἔμ᾽ ἐκεῖνος.’
τὴν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:
‘τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλ᾽ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω.
μήτηρ μέν τέ μέ φησι τοῦ ἔμμεναι, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε   215
οὐκ οἶδ᾽: οὐ γάρ πώ τις ἑὸν γόνον αὐτὸς ἀνέγνω.
ὡς δὴ ἐγώ γ᾽ ὄφελον μάκαρός νύ τευ ἔμμεναι υἱὸς
ἀνέρος, ὃν κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖς ἔπι γῆρας ἔτετμε.
νῦν δ᾽ ὃς ἀποτμότατος γένετο θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων,
τοῦ μ᾽ ἔκ φασι γενέσθαι, ἐπεὶ σύ με τοῦτ᾽ ἐρεείνεις.’    220
========================================
Indeed, in your head and your handsome eyes you greatly resemble him,
for we often mixed it up with each other,
at least until he left for Troy, where other men as well,
the best of the Argives, went in their hollow ships:
from that time on I didn't see Odysseus, nor he me."
Then wise Telemachus faced her and spoke again:
"Well, then, stranger, I'll tell you precisely.
Indeed my mother tells me that I am his, yet I for one
do not know: for no-one knows whose child he is.
Would that I had been the son of some fortunate man,
whom old age overtook on his own estates.
But now this man has become the most unfortunate of mortal men,
they say that I was born of him, since you ask me this."
========================================
τὸν δ᾽ αὖτε προσέειπε θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:
‘οὐ μέν τοι γενεήν γε θεοὶ νώνυμνον ὀπίσσω
θῆκαν, ἐπεὶ σέ γε τοῖον ἐγείνατο Πηνελόπεια.
ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον:
τίς δαίς, τίς δὲ ὅμιλος ὅδ᾽ ἔπλετο; τίπτε δέ σε χρεώ;    225
εἰλαπίνη ἠὲ γάμος; ἐπεὶ οὐκ ἔρανος τάδε γ᾽ ἐστίν:
ὥς τέ μοι ὑβρίζοντες ὑπερφιάλως δοκέουσι
δαίνυσθαι κατὰ δῶμα. νεμεσσήσαιτό κεν ἀνὴρ
αἴσχεα πόλλ᾽ ὁρόων, ὅς τις πινυτός γε μετέλθοι.’
τὴν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:
‘ξεῖν᾽, ἐπεὶ ἂρ δὴ ταῦτά μ᾽ ἀνείρεαι ἠδὲ μεταλλᾷς,
μέλλεν μέν ποτε οἶκος ὅδ᾽ ἀφνειὸς καὶ ἀμύμων
ἔμμεναι, ὄφρ᾽ ἔτι κεῖνος ἀνὴρ ἐπιδήμιος ἦεν:
νῦν δ᾽ ἑτέρως ἐβόλοντο θεοὶ κακὰ μητιόωντες,
οἳ κεῖνον μὲν ἄιστον ἐποίησαν περὶ πάντων    235
ἀνθρώπων, ἐπεὶ οὔ κε θανόντι περ ὧδ᾽ ἀκαχοίμην,
εἰ μετὰ οἷς ἑτάροισι δάμη Τρώων ἐνὶ δήμῳ,
ἠὲ φίλων ἐν χερσίν, ἐπεὶ πόλεμον τολύπευσεν.
========================================
The goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, spoke to him again:
"Indeed, the gods have not made your family nameless in days to come,
when Penelope bore such a one as you.
But come, tell me this and recount it truly:
What meal and what crowd is this? Pray tell me what it is.
A banquet or a wedding? Since this is no potluck:
and so it seems to me that these men are haughtily carousing 
and feasting all over the house.  Any man seeing it,
any prudent man, should feel wrath at the many disgraces."
Wise Telemachus answered her again:
"Stranger, since indeed you question and inquire of these things,
this house was once rich and noble,
so long as that man was still among his people:
but now the gods have wished otherwise, devising evil,
they've put that man beyond the sight of everyone.
I'd not have mourned his dying so,
if he'd been killed with his comrades in the land of Troy,
or in the arms of his friends, after he wound off the wool of war.
========================================

τῷ κέν οἱ τύμβον μὲν ἐποίησαν Παναχαιοί,
ἠδέ κε καὶ ᾧ παιδὶ μέγα κλέος ἤρατ᾽ ὀπίσσω.    240
νῦν δέ μιν ἀκλειῶς ἅρπυιαι ἀνηρείψαντο:
οἴχετ᾽ ἄιστος ἄπυστος, ἐμοὶ δ᾽ ὀδύνας τε γόους τε
κάλλιπεν. οὐδέ τι κεῖνον ὀδυρόμενος στεναχίζω
οἶον, ἐπεί νύ μοι ἄλλα θεοὶ κακὰ κήδε᾽ ἔτευξαν.
ὅσσοι γὰρ νήσοισιν ἐπικρατέουσιν ἄριστοι,   245
Δουλιχίῳ τε Σάμῃ τε καὶ ὑλήεντι Ζακύνθῳ,
ἠδ᾽ ὅσσοι κραναὴν Ἰθάκην κάτα κοιρανέουσιν,
τόσσοι μητέρ᾽ ἐμὴν μνῶνται, τρύχουσι δὲ οἶκον.
ἡ δ᾽ οὔτ᾽ ἀρνεῖται στυγερὸν γάμον οὔτε τελευτὴν
ποιῆσαι δύναται: τοὶ δὲ φθινύθουσιν ἔδοντες   250
οἶκον ἐμόν: τάχα δή με διαρραίσουσι καὶ αὐτόν.’
========================================
All of the Achaeans would've built him a barrow,
and great fame would've been taken up by his son as well.
But now the harpies have ignominiously snatched him away:
he's gone, unseen, unheard, leaving me to grief and tears.
But I don't lament and grieve only for him,
for the gods have now readied other evil griefs for me.
For the noblest men who rule over the islands,
Doulichion and Same and forested Zacynthus,
and such men who are lords in rocky Ithaca,
they all woo my mother, and lay waste to the house.
She can neither refuse the loathsome wedding nor 
bring it to completion: they comsume my house
with their eating: indeed, they'll soon destroy me as well.
========================================

τὸν δ᾽ ἐπαλαστήσασα προσηύδα Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη:
‘ὢ πόποι, ἦ δὴ πολλὸν ἀποιχομένου Ὀδυσῆος
δεύῃ, ὅ κε μνηστῆρσιν ἀναιδέσι χεῖρας ἐφείη.
εἰ γὰρ νῦν ἐλθὼν δόμου ἐν πρώτῃσι θύρῃσι    255
σταίη, ἔχων πήληκα καὶ ἀσπίδα καὶ δύο δοῦρε,
τοῖος ἐὼν οἷόν μιν ἐγὼ τὰ πρῶτ᾽ ἐνόησα
οἴκῳ ἐν ἡμετέρῳ πίνοντά τε τερπόμενόν τε,
ἐξ Ἐφύρης ἀνιόντα παρ᾽ Ἴλου Μερμερίδαο—   260
ᾤχετο γὰρ καὶ κεῖσε θοῆς ἐπὶ νηὸς Ὀδυσσεὺς
φάρμακον ἀνδροφόνον διζήμενος, ὄφρα οἱ εἴη
ἰοὺς χρίεσθαι χαλκήρεας: ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν οὔ οἱ

ἀλλὰ πατήρ οἱ δῶκεν ἐμός: φιλέεσκε γὰρ αἰνῶς—   265
τοῖος ἐὼν μνηστῆρσιν ὁμιλήσειεν Ὀδυσσεύς:
πάντες κ᾽ ὠκύμοροί τε γενοίατο πικρόγαμοί τε.
========================================
Pallas Athena, filled with wrath, addressed him:
"Shame, indeed! You very much need long gone Odysseus,
that he might lay hands on the shameless wooers.
Would that he had arrived and was now standing at the outermost doors,
with his helmet and shield and two spears,
such as he was when I saw him at the doors 
of our house, cheerfully drinking,
when he came back from Ephyra, from Ilus the son of Mermsesus -
for Odysseus traveled there on a swift ship
seeking a murderous drug, to coat his
bronze-tipped arrows with: but that man didn't give
it to him, because he stood in awe of the gods, who are eternal,
but my father gave it to him: for he loved him terribly -
such a one as Odysseus could deal with the wooers,
who'd all find themselves bitterly wed and dying young.
========================================

ἀλλ᾽ ἦ τοι μὲν ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται,
ἤ κεν νοστήσας ἀποτίσεται, ἦε καὶ οὐκί,
οἷσιν ἐνὶ μεγάροισι: σὲ δὲ φράζεσθαι ἄνωγα,
ὅππως κε μνηστῆρας ἀπώσεαι ἐκ μεγάροιο.   270
εἰ δ᾽ ἄγε νῦν ξυνίει καὶ ἐμῶν ἐμπάζεο μύθων:
αὔριον εἰς ἀγορὴν καλέσας ἥρωας Ἀχαιοὺς
μῦθον πέφραδε πᾶσι, θεοὶ δ᾽ ἐπὶ μάρτυροι ἔστων.
μνηστῆρας μὲν ἐπὶ σφέτερα σκίδνασθαι ἄνωχθι,
μητέρα δ᾽, εἴ οἱ θυμὸς ἐφορμᾶται γαμέεσθαι,   275
ἂψ ἴτω ἐς μέγαρον πατρὸς μέγα δυναμένοιο:
οἱ δὲ γάμον τεύξουσι καὶ ἀρτυνέουσιν ἔεδνα
πολλὰ μάλ᾽, ὅσσα ἔοικε φίλης ἐπὶ παιδὸς ἕπεσθαι.
σοὶ δ᾽ αὐτῷ πυκινῶς ὑποθήσομαι, αἴ κε πίθηαι:
νῆ᾽ ἄρσας ἐρέτῃσιν ἐείκοσιν, ἥ τις ἀρίστη,   280
ἔρχεο πευσόμενος πατρὸς δὴν οἰχομένοιο,
ἤν τίς τοι εἴπῃσι βροτῶν, ἢ ὄσσαν ἀκούσῃς
ἐκ Διός, ἥ τε μάλιστα φέρει κλέος ἀνθρώποισι.
========================================

But these things truly lie in the lap of the gods,
whether or not he will return and take his vengeance
in his halls: but I advise you to think on
how to drive the wooers from the hall.
Come now, listen up and take heed of my words:
tomorrow, summon the Achaean heros into the assembly
and make a speech to them all, and let the gods be your witnesses.
Command the suitors to disperse, each to his own,
and your mother, if her desire should be roused to marriage,
let her go back to her powerful father's great hall:
they will prepare a wedding for her and will prepare many 
wedding gifts, as many as is fit to be in keeping upon a beloved child.
To you yourself I'll firmly suggest, if you'll listen to me:
fit out a ship, one of the best, with twenty oarsmen,
and set out to learn of your long traveling father,
if any mortal man tells you, or you hear a rumor 
from Zeus, who above all brings good news to men.
========================================

πρῶτα μὲν ἐς Πύλον ἐλθὲ καὶ εἴρεο Νέστορα δῖον,
κεῖθεν δὲ Σπάρτηνδε παρὰ ξανθὸν Μενέλαον:   285
ὃς γὰρ δεύτατος ἦλθεν Ἀχαιῶν χαλκοχιτώνων.
εἰ μέν κεν πατρὸς βίοτον καὶ νόστον ἀκούσῃς,
ἦ τ᾽ ἂν τρυχόμενός περ ἔτι τλαίης ἐνιαυτόν:
εἰ δέ κε τεθνηῶτος ἀκούσῃς μηδ᾽ ἔτ᾽ ἐόντος,
νοστήσας δὴ ἔπειτα φίλην ἐς πατρίδα γαῖαν   290
σῆμά τέ οἱ χεῦαι καὶ ἐπὶ κτέρεα κτερεΐξαι
πολλὰ μάλ᾽, ὅσσα ἔοικε, καὶ ἀνέρι μητέρα δοῦναι.
αὐτὰρ ἐπὴν δὴ ταῦτα τελευτήσῃς τε καὶ ἔρξῃς,
φράζεσθαι δὴ ἔπειτα κατὰ φρένα καὶ κατὰ θυμὸν
ὅππως κε μνηστῆρας ἐνὶ μεγάροισι τεοῖσι   295
κτείνῃς ἠὲ δόλῳ ἢ ἀμφαδόν: οὐδέ τί σε χρὴ
νηπιάας ὀχέειν, ἐπεὶ οὐκέτι τηλίκος ἐσσι.
ἢ οὐκ ἀίεις οἷον κλέος ἔλλαβε δῖος Ὀρέστης
πάντας ἐπ᾽ ἀνθρώπους, ἐπεὶ ἔκτανε πατροφονῆα,
Αἴγισθον δολόμητιν, ὅ οἱ πατέρα κλυτὸν ἔκτα;   300
========================================
First go to Pylos and question noble Nestor,
and from there to Sparta to the house of fair-haired Menelaus:
for he was the last of the bronze-clad Achaeans to reach home.
If you should hear that your father is alive and on his way,
truly then, worn-out as you are, you could hold out for a year:
but if you should hear that he has died and is no more,
then when you come home to your dear native land
raise a mound for him and burn on it a pile of funeral gifts,
as many as is fit, and give your mother to a husband.
But when you've done and finished all of this,
consider then in your heart and guts
how in the world to kill the wooers in your halls
either by treachery or in the open: it doesn't behoove you
to hold fast to childhood, since you're no longer of such an age.
Don't you know the glory that the divine Orestes took
among all men, when he killed the father-killer,
sneaky Aigisthos, who slew his renowned father?
========================================

καὶ σύ, φίλος, μάλα γάρ σ᾽ ὁρόω καλόν τε μέγαν τε,
ἄλκιμος ἔσσ᾽, ἵνα τίς σε καὶ ὀψιγόνων ἐὺ εἴπῃ.
αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν ἐπὶ νῆα θοὴν κατελεύσομαι ἤδη
ἠδ᾽ ἑτάρους, οἵ πού με μάλ᾽ ἀσχαλόωσι μένοντες:
σοὶ δ᾽ αὐτῷ μελέτω, καὶ ἐμῶν ἐμπάζεο μύθων.’    305
τὴν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:
‘ξεῖν᾽, ἦ τοι μὲν ταῦτα φίλα φρονέων ἀγορεύεις,
ὥς τε πατὴρ ᾧ παιδί, καὶ οὔ ποτε λήσομαι αὐτῶν.
ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε νῦν ἐπίμεινον, ἐπειγόμενός περ ὁδοῖο,
ὄφρα λοεσσάμενός τε τεταρπόμενός τε φίλον κῆρ,   310
δῶρον ἔχων ἐπὶ νῆα κίῃς, χαίρων ἐνὶ θυμῷ,
τιμῆεν, μάλα καλόν, ὅ τοι κειμήλιον ἔσται
ἐξ ἐμεῦ, οἷα φίλοι ξεῖνοι ξείνοισι διδοῦσι.’
========================================
And you, buddy, for I see that you are very handsome and tall,
be brave, and any of those not yet born might speak well of you, 
but I'm heading down to my swift ship right now,
and to my comrades, who are surely waiting on pins and needles for me:
but you take great care and heed my words."
Wise Telemachus spoke to her in turn:
"Sage friend, truly, what you say is well meant,
like a father to his son, and I'll never forget it.
But come, stay awhile, you who yearn for the road,
and when you've bathed and cheered your heart,
then may you go to your ship rejoicing in your soul, bearing a gift
that is prized and very beautiful, which will be an keepsake for you
from me, of the sort that dear friends give to friends."
========================================

τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:
‘μή μ᾽ ἔτι νῦν κατέρυκε, λιλαιόμενόν περ ὁδοῖο.   315
δῶρον δ᾽ ὅττι κέ μοι δοῦναι φίλον ἦτορ ἀνώγῃ,
αὖτις ἀνερχομένῳ δόμεναι οἶκόνδε φέρεσθαι,
καὶ μάλα καλὸν ἑλών: σοὶ δ᾽ ἄξιον ἔσται ἀμοιβῆς.’
ἡ μὲν ἄρ᾽ ὣς εἰποῦσ᾽ ἀπέβη γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη,
ὄρνις δ᾽ ὣς ἀνόπαια διέπτατο: τῷ δ᾽ ἐνὶ θυμῷ   320
θῆκε μένος καὶ θάρσος, ὑπέμνησέν τέ ἑ πατρὸς
μᾶλλον ἔτ᾽ ἢ τὸ πάροιθεν. ὁ δὲ φρεσὶν ᾗσι νοήσας
θάμβησεν κατὰ θυμόν: ὀίσατο γὰρ θεὸν εἶναι.
αὐτίκα δὲ μνηστῆρας ἐπῴχετο ἰσόθεος φώς.
τοῖσι δ᾽ ἀοιδὸς ἄειδε περικλυτός, οἱ δὲ σιωπῇ
ἥατ᾽ ἀκούοντες: ὁ δ᾽ Ἀχαιῶν νόστον ἄειδε
λυγρόν, ὃν ἐκ Τροίης ἐπετείλατο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη.
τοῦ δ᾽ ὑπερωιόθεν φρεσὶ σύνθετο θέσπιν ἀοιδὴν
κούρη Ἰκαρίοιο, περίφρων Πηνελόπεια:
========================================
Then the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, answered him:
"Don't hold me back any longer, I'm dead set on traveling.
The gift that your dear heart urges you to give me,
give it to me when I return again, to carry home,
I'll pick out a fine one as well: which will be a fair recompense for you."
And after speaking thus Athena of the gleaming eyes departed,
and flew away, unnoticed, as a bird: she put 
might and courage in his heart, and called his father to his mind
even more than before.  He reflected inwardly,
awe-struck through his soul: for he felt that this was a god.
This god-like man at once approached the wooers.
The renowned bard was singing to them, they in silence
sat and listened: he sang of the Achaeans' mournful return from Troy,
which Pallas Athena had commanded.
In an upper chamber a daughter of the Icarian Sea, thoughtful Penelope,
listened to the divinely inspired song.

========================================
κλίμακα δ᾽ ὑψηλὴν κατεβήσετο οἷο δόμοιο,    330
οὐκ οἴη, ἅμα τῇ γε καὶ ἀμφίπολοι δύ᾽ ἕποντο.
ἡ δ᾽ ὅτε δὴ μνηστῆρας ἀφίκετο δῖα γυναικῶν,
στῆ ῥα παρὰ σταθμὸν τέγεος πύκα ποιητοῖο,
ἄντα παρειάων σχομένη λιπαρὰ κρήδεμνα:
ἀμφίπολος δ᾽ ἄρα οἱ κεδνὴ ἑκάτερθε παρέστη.    335
δακρύσασα δ᾽ ἔπειτα προσηύδα θεῖον ἀοιδόν:
‘Φήμιε, πολλὰ γὰρ ἄλλα βροτῶν θελκτήρια οἶδας,
ἔργ᾽ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε, τά τε κλείουσιν ἀοιδοί:
τῶν ἕν γέ σφιν ἄειδε παρήμενος, οἱ δὲ σιωπῇ
οἶνον πινόντων: ταύτης δ᾽ ἀποπαύε᾽ ἀοιδῆς    340
λυγρῆς, ἥ τέ μοι αἰεὶ ἐνὶ στήθεσσι φίλον κῆρ
τείρει, ἐπεί με μάλιστα καθίκετο πένθος ἄλαστον.
τοίην γὰρ κεφαλὴν ποθέω μεμνημένη αἰεί,
ἀνδρός, τοῦ κλέος εὐρὺ καθ᾽ Ἑλλάδα καὶ μέσον Ἄργος.’
========================================

She walked down the long staircase of her house,
but not alone, as she descended, two handmaids followed.
Then she, the noblest of women, approached the wooers,
and stopped beside the post bearing the weight of the well-built roof,
before her cheeks she wore a brilliant veil:
a trusty handmaid stood just to either side.
She wept and then addressed the god-like singer:
"Phimius, you know many other songs to charm mortal men,
the deeds of men and gods, that bards celebrate:
sit down and sing them one of those instead, and let them drink
their wine in silence: leave off that mournful song,
it always distresses the dear heart in my breast,
since unbearable grief has touched me.
For I always remember such a head, and long for my husband,
whose fame reaches wide throughout Hellas and Middle Argus."

========================================

τὴν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:   345
‘μῆτερ ἐμή, τί τ᾽ ἄρα φθονέεις ἐρίηρον ἀοιδὸν
τέρπειν ὅππῃ οἱ νόος ὄρνυται; οὔ νύ τ᾽ ἀοιδοὶ
αἴτιοι, ἀλλά ποθι Ζεὺς αἴτιος, ὅς τε δίδωσιν
ἀνδράσιν ἀλφηστῇσιν, ὅπως ἐθέλῃσιν, ἑκάστῳ.
τούτῳ δ᾽ οὐ νέμεσις Δαναῶν κακὸν οἶτον ἀείδειν:   350
τὴν γὰρ ἀοιδὴν μᾶλλον ἐπικλείουσ᾽ ἄνθρωποι,
ἥ τις ἀκουόντεσσι νεωτάτη ἀμφιπέληται.
σοί δ᾽ ἐπιτολμάτω κραδίη καὶ θυμὸς ἀκούειν:
οὐ γὰρ Ὀδυσσεὺς οἶος ἀπώλεσε νόστιμον ἦμαρ
ἐν Τροίῃ, πολλοὶ δὲ καὶ ἄλλοι φῶτες ὄλοντο.    355
ἀλλ᾽ εἰς οἶκον ἰοῦσα τὰ σ᾽ αὐτῆς ἔργα κόμιζε,
ἱστόν τ᾽ ἠλακάτην τε, καὶ ἀμφιπόλοισι κέλευε
ἔργον ἐποίχεσθαι: μῦθος δ᾽ ἄνδρεσσι μελήσει
πᾶσι, μάλιστα δ᾽ ἐμοί: τοῦ γὰρ κράτος ἔστ᾽ ἐνὶ οἴκῳ.’
========================================
Then wise Telemachus turned to her and spoke:
"Mother mine, why do you resent how the faithful singer
gives pleasure in whatever way his mind is moved?  Now bards aren't 
to blame, but Zeus probably is, he who grants
whatever he wishes to each working man.
There's no cause to get mad if this man sings the ill fate of Danaos' daughters:
for men praise the song all the more,
it being the newest song to meet their ears.
Let your heart and soul dare you to listen to it:
for not only Odysseus lost his day of homecoming
in Troy, but many other men were lost.
But get to your chamber and take care of your own tasks,
your loom and distaff, and order your handmaids
to get to work: speech will be of interest to men,
to all men, but especially to me: for authority in this house is mine.
========================================
ἡ μὲν θαμβήσασα πάλιν οἶκόνδε βεβήκει:    360

τοῖσι δὲ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἤρχετο μύθων:

========================================
Amazed, she returned to her chamber:
for she had stored her son's wise speech in her heart.
She walked up to the upper room with her waiting women.
Then she wept for Odysseus, her beloved husband, until
Athena of the gleaming eyes let sweet slumber fall upon her eyelids.
But the wooers made a din up and down the dark halls,
and they all prayed to recline beside her on her bed.
Wise Telemachus commenced a speech to them:
"My mother's wooers, lustful and violent,
let us now take cheer in the banquet, and let there be no clamor,
when it is so fine to listen to such a bard
as this one is, whose voice is like to the gods.
In the morning, let us all go to the assembly and sit down,
and there let me give you a blunt speech,
to dismiss you from these halls: find other feasts,
devouring your own property and changing from house to house.
========================================
εἰ δ᾽ ὕμιν δοκέει τόδε λωίτερον καὶ ἄμεινον

νήποινοί κεν ἔπειτα δόμων ἔντοσθεν ὄλοισθε.’        380
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽, οἱ δ᾽ ἄρα πάντες ὀδὰξ ἐν χείλεσι φύντες
Τηλέμαχον θαύμαζον, ὃ θαρσαλέως ἀγόρευεν.
τὸν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Ἀντίνοος προσέφη, Εὐπείθεος υἱός:
‘Τηλέμαχ᾽, ἦ μάλα δή σε διδάσκουσιν θεοὶ αὐτοὶ
ὑψαγόρην τ᾽ ἔμεναι καὶ θαρσαλέως ἀγορεύειν:       385
μὴ σέ γ᾽ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλῆα Κρονίων
ποιήσειεν, ὅ τοι γενεῇ πατρώιόν ἐστιν.’
τὸν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:
‘Ἀντίνο᾽, ἦ καί μοι νεμεσήσεαι ὅττι κεν εἴπω;
καὶ κεν τοῦτ᾽ ἐθέλοιμι Διός γε διδόντος ἀρέσθαι.      390
========================================
If it seems to you that it is more desirable and better
for the livelihood of one man to be destroyed with impunity,
then go ahead and fleece him: but I will invoke the ever-living gods,
if ever Zeus grant that deeds of requital be done:
without recompense then may you perish within my home."
As he spoke, all of them bit their lips and
marvelled at Telemachus, who was boldly haranguing them.
And then Antinous, the son of Eupeides, addressed him:
"Telemachus, truly the gods themselves instruct you
both to be a braggart and to boldly harangue us:
May the son of Cronos, your family's fore-bearer,
not make you king in sea-girt Ithaca."
Wise Telemachus responded back at him:
"Really, Antinous, do you resent what I have said?
Even this I would be willing to undertake, with Zeus so granting.
========================================
ἦ φῂς τοῦτο κάκιστον ἐν ἀνθρώποισι τετύχθαι;
οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακὸν βασιλευέμεν: αἶψά τέ οἱ δῶ
ἀφνειὸν πέλεται καὶ τιμηέστερος αὐτός.
ἀλλ᾽ ἦ τοι βασιλῆες Ἀχαιῶν εἰσὶ καὶ ἄλλοι
πολλοὶ ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ, νέοι ἠδὲ παλαιοί,    395
τῶν κέν τις τόδ᾽ ἔχῃσιν, ἐπεὶ θάνε δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς:
αὐτὰρ ἐγὼν οἴκοιο ἄναξ ἔσομ᾽ ἡμετέροιο
καὶ δμώων, οὕς μοι ληίσσατο δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς.’
τὸν δ᾽ αὖτ᾽ Εὐρύμαχος Πολύβου πάϊς ἀντίον ηὔδα:
‘Τηλέμαχ᾽, ἦ τοι ταῦτα θεῶν ἐν γούνασι κεῖται,     400
ὅς τις ἐν ἀμφιάλῳ Ἰθάκῃ βασιλεύσει Ἀχαιῶν:
κτήματα δ᾽ αὐτὸς ἔχοις καὶ δώμασιν οἷσιν ἀνάσσοις.
μὴ γὰρ ὅ γ᾽ ἔλθοι ἀνὴρ ὅς τίς σ᾽ ἀέκοντα βίηφιν
κτήματ᾽ ἀπορραίσει, Ἰθάκης ἔτι ναιετοώσης.
========================================
Do you really think this the worst thing that could happen to a man?
For it's not a bad thing to rule: your house quickly becomes
wealthy and you yourself are honored more.
But surely you have other Achaean kings,
and many in sea-girt Ithaca, young and old,
perhaps one of them might take this realm, since godlike Odysseus has died.
Nevertheless, I will be the master of our house,
and of the slaves that godlike Odysseus captured for me."
And then Eurymachos, son of Polybus, answered him:
"Telemachus, for you it surely rests on the knees of the gods,
which of the Achaeans will reign in sea-girt Ithaca:
while you yourself may keep your possessions and be lord in your own house.
May no man set out to rob you
of your possessions by force, so long as Ithaca is inhabited.

ἀλλ᾽ ἐθέλω σε, φέριστε, περὶ ξείνοιο ἐρέσθαι,   405
ὁππόθεν οὗτος ἀνήρ, ποίης δ᾽ ἐξ εὔχεται εἶναι

ἠέ τιν᾽ ἀγγελίην πατρὸς φέρει ἐρχομένοιο,
ἦ ἑὸν αὐτοῦ χρεῖος ἐελδόμενος τόδ᾽ ἱκάνει;
οἷον ἀναΐξας ἄφαρ οἴχεται, οὐδ᾽ ὑπέμεινε   410
γνώμεναι: οὐ μὲν γάρ τι κακῷ εἰς ὦπα ἐῴκει.’
τὸν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:

‘Εὐρύμαχ᾽, ἦ τοι νόστος ἀπώλετο πατρὸς ἐμοῖο:
οὔτ᾽ οὖν ἀγγελίῃ ἔτι πείθομαι, εἴ ποθεν ἔλθοι,

οὔτε θεοπροπίης ἐμπάζομαι, ἥν τινα μήτηρ   415
ἐς μέγαρον καλέσασα θεοπρόπον ἐξερέηται.

ξεῖνος δ᾽ οὗτος ἐμὸς πατρώιος ἐκ Τάφου ἐστίν,
Μέντης δ᾽ Ἀγχιάλοιο δαΐφρονος εὔχεται εἶναι

υἱός, ἀτὰρ Ταφίοισι φιληρέτμοισιν ἀνάσσει.’
ὣς φάτο Τηλέμαχος, φρεσὶ δ᾽ ἀθανάτην θεὸν ἔγνω.    420
========================================
AJC But, my good man, I want to ask you about the stranger,
from which land does that man claim to be,

AJC where his family is now and where the land of his fathers.
Does he bring some message of your father's coming

AJC or does he come on some business of his own?
How he sprang up at once and went, and did not wait

AJC to make himself known: but he looked not bad at all in his face."
Again, wise Telemachus answered him:

AJC "Eurymachos, I tell you that my father's home-coming is truly lost:
and so I neither trust a message, that might have come from anywhere,

AJC nor take heed of a prophesy, were my mother to summon a seer
into the great hall to interrogate.

AJC This is my father's friend from Taphos,
he boasts to Mentes, the son of warlike Anchialos, 

AJC and he is lord to the oar-loving Taphians."
Thus spoke Telemachus, but in his guts he knew the immortal goddess.
