ἄνδρα μοι ἔννεπε, μοῦσα, πολύτροπον, ὃς μάλα πολλὰ    1
πλάγχθη, ἐπεὶ Τροίης ἱερὸν πτολίεθρον ἔπερσεν:
πολλῶν δ᾽ ἀνθρώπων ἴδεν ἄστεα καὶ νόον ἔγνω,
πολλὰ δ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ὃν κατὰ θυμόν,
ἀρνύμενος ἥν τε ψυχὴν καὶ νόστον ἑταίρων.     5
ἀλλ᾽ οὐδ᾽ ὣς ἑτάρους ἐρρύσατο, ἱέμενός περ:
αὐτῶν γὰρ σφετέρῃσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὄλοντο,
νήπιοι, οἳ κατὰ βοῦς Ὑπερίονος Ἠελίοιο
ἤσθιον: αὐτὰρ ὁ τοῖσιν ἀφείλετο νόστιμον ἦμαρ.
τῶν ἁμόθεν γε, θεά, θύγατερ Διός, εἰπὲ καὶ ἡμῖν.   10
ἔνθ᾽ ἄλλοι μὲν πάντες, ὅσοι φύγον αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον,
οἴκοι ἔσαν, πόλεμόν τε πεφευγότες ἠδὲ θάλασσαν:
τὸν δ᾽ οἶον νόστου κεχρημένον ἠδὲ γυναικὸς
νύμφη πότνι᾽ ἔρυκε Καλυψὼ δῖα θεάων
ἐν σπέσσι γλαφυροῖσι, λιλαιομένη πόσιν εἶναι.    15
====================================================
Tell me, Muse, about that wily man, who wandered far and wide
after laying waste to Troy's sacred citadel.
He saw the towns and came to know the minds of many men,
he endured much grief at sea deep in his soul,
striving to save his own and his comrades' lives and their return to Greece.
But he couldn't rescue his comrades, as much as he would have liked:
for they were destroyed by their own wickedness,
children who ate the bulls of Hyperion Helios:
who robbed them of the day of their return.
Tell us of these things, goddess, daughter of Zeus, starting wherever you like. 
The others, all who fled utter destruction then,
were home, those who escaped both war and sea:
A lonely man yearning for his home-coming and for his wife,
the nymph Mistress Calypso, the noblest of the goddesses, detained him
in a cavern, longing for him to be her husband.
====================================================

ἀλλ᾽ ὅτε δὴ ἔτος ἦλθε περιπλομένων ἐνιαυτῶν,
τῷ οἱ ἐπεκλώσαντο θεοὶ οἶκόνδε νέεσθαι
εἰς Ἰθάκην, οὐδ᾽ ἔνθα πεφυγμένος ἦεν ἀέθλων
καὶ μετὰ οἷσι φίλοισι. θεοὶ δ᾽ ἐλέαιρον ἅπαντες
νόσφι Ποσειδάωνος: ὁ δ᾽ ἀσπερχὲς μενέαινεν    20
ἀντιθέῳ Ὀδυσῆι πάρος ἣν γαῖαν ἱκέσθαι.
ἀλλ᾽ ὁ μὲν Αἰθίοπας μετεκίαθε τηλόθ᾽ ἐόντας,
Αἰθίοπας τοὶ διχθὰ δεδαίαται, ἔσχατοι ἀνδρῶν,
οἱ μὲν δυσομένου Ὑπερίονος οἱ δ᾽ ἀνιόντος,
ἀντιόων ταύρων τε καὶ ἀρνειῶν ἑκατόμβης.    25
ἔνθ᾽ ὅ γ᾽ ἐτέρπετο δαιτὶ παρήμενος: οἱ δὲ δὴ ἄλλοι
Ζηνὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν Ὀλυμπίου ἁθρόοι ἦσαν.
τοῖσι δὲ μύθων ἦρχε πατὴρ ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε:
μνήσατο γὰρ κατὰ θυμὸν ἀμύμονος Αἰγίσθοιο,
τόν ῥ᾽ Ἀγαμεμνονίδης τηλεκλυτὸς ἔκταν᾽ Ὀρέστης:    30
====================================================

But indeed as time rolled on there came a year
when the gods fated that he go home
to Ithica, but even after he made it there he still struggled,
even among his loved ones.  All the gods took pity on him
except Poseidon: he raged unceasingly against
godlike Odysseus until he came to his own land.
But he was visiting the far off Ethiopians,
the most distant of men, split in two parts,
some where Hyperion sinks and some where it rises,
going there to receive an offering of a hundred each of bulls and rams.
He enjoyed himself there, sitting at the feast: while the others
crowded together in Olympian Zeus' great halls.
The father of men and of gods was first to speak to them:
for deep in his soul he was minded of noble Aigisthos,
whom Agamemnon's son, the far-famed Orestes, had killed:
====================================================

τοῦ ὅ γ᾽ ἐπιμνησθεὶς ἔπε᾽ ἀθανάτοισι μετηύδα:
‘ὢ πόποι, οἷον δή νυ θεοὺς βροτοὶ αἰτιόωνται:
ἐξ ἡμέων γάρ φασι κάκ᾽ ἔμμεναι, οἱ δὲ καὶ αὐτοὶ
σφῇσιν ἀτασθαλίῃσιν ὑπὲρ μόρον ἄλγε᾽ ἔχουσιν,
ὡς καὶ νῦν Αἴγισθος ὑπὲρ μόρον Ἀτρεΐδαο    35
γῆμ᾽ ἄλοχον μνηστήν, τὸν δ᾽ ἔκτανε νοστήσαντα,
εἰδὼς αἰπὺν ὄλεθρον, ἐπεὶ πρό οἱ εἴπομεν ἡμεῖς,
Ἑρμείαν πέμψαντες, ἐύσκοπον ἀργεϊφόντην,
μήτ᾽ αὐτὸν κτείνειν μήτε μνάασθαι ἄκοιτιν:
ἐκ γὰρ Ὀρέσταο τίσις ἔσσεται Ἀτρεΐδαο,    40
ὁππότ᾽ ἂν ἡβήσῃ τε καὶ ἧς ἱμείρεται αἴης.
ὣς ἔφαθ᾽ Ἑρμείας, ἀλλ᾽ οὐ φρένας Αἰγίσθοιο
πεῖθ᾽ ἀγαθὰ φρονέων: νῦν δ᾽ ἁθρόα πάντ᾽ ἀπέτισεν.’
====================================================
And he was thinking of him when he addressed the Immortals:
"Oh shame, how mortals now blame the gods:
for they say that evil comes from us, while they
of their own fault bear sufferings due to their own wickedness,
as even now Aigisthos sealed his fate by bedding Agamemnon's
wedded wife, and slaying him on his return,
despite knowing it was his ruin, since beforehand we ourselves
sent Hermes, the keen-sighted slayer of Argus, to tell him
to neither slay him nor to woo his wife:
for from Orestes would come vengeance for Atreus' son
when he had grown up and longed for his land.
Hermes said this, but Aigisthos' heart was not persuaded,
minded of good things: now he paid for it all in full."
====================================================
τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:
‘ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων,    45
καὶ λίην κεῖνός γε ἐοικότι κεῖται ὀλέθρῳ:
ὡς ἀπόλοιτο καὶ ἄλλος, ὅτις τοιαῦτά γε ῥέζοι:
ἀλλά μοι ἀμφ᾽ Ὀδυσῆι δαΐφρονι δαίεται ἦτορ,
δυσμόρῳ, ὃς δὴ δηθὰ φίλων ἄπο πήματα πάσχει

αἰεὶ δὲ μαλακοῖσι καὶ αἱμυλίοισι λόγοισιν

========================================
Then the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, answered him:
"Our father, the son of Cronos, the highest of lords,
indeed that man sprawls in a fitting destruction:
and may anyone who does such things as these be destroyed as well:
but my heart is torn for ill-fated warlike Odysseus,
who suffers from calamities, so far from his friends,
on a sea-girt island, the navel of the sea.
A wooded island, in a house there dwells a goddess,
the daughter of baleful Atlas, who knows the depths
of the whole sea, and who holds the tall pillars
that hold the earth and sky apart.
His daughter detains the wretched mournful man,
ever with soft and fawning words she beguiles him,
to make him forget Ithaca: nevertheless Odysseus
longing to see even the smoke rising
from his homeland, wishes to die.  Your dear heart doesn't yet
feel misgivings, Olympian. Was not Odysseus of Argos
willingly performing sacrifices beside his ships
in far-spread Troy?  What do you now hate in him so greatly, Zeus?"
========================================
τὴν δ᾽ ἀπαμειβόμενος προσέφη νεφεληγερέτα Ζεύς:
‘τέκνον ἐμόν, ποῖόν σε ἔπος φύγεν ἕρκος ὀδόντων.
πῶς ἂν ἔπειτ᾽ Ὀδυσῆος ἐγὼ θείοιο λαθοίμην,   65
ὃς περὶ μὲν νόον ἐστὶ βροτῶν, περὶ δ᾽ ἱρὰ θεοῖσιν
ἀθανάτοισιν ἔδωκε, τοὶ οὐρανὸν εὐρὺν ἔχουσιν;
ἀλλὰ Ποσειδάων γαιήοχος ἀσκελὲς αἰεὶ

ἀλλ᾽ ἄγεθ᾽, ἡμεῖς οἵδε περιφραζώμεθα πάντες

ὃν χόλον: οὐ μὲν γὰρ τι δυνήσεται ἀντία πάντων
ἀθανάτων ἀέκητι θεῶν ἐριδαινέμεν οἶος.’
========================================
Answering her, Zeus the cloud-gatherer said:
"My child, what a speech has escaped your wall of teeth.
How could I forget the godlike Odysseus,
he who is above mortals in resolve, who offered more than a priest
to the immortal gods, who inhabit the broad heavens?
But earth-carrying Poseidon was unceasingly
angered about the Cyclops whom he blinded,
godlike Polyphemus, whose strength is greater
than all other Cyclopses - the nymph Thoosa bore him,
the daughter of Phorcys, the ruler of the barren sea -
she'd been shagged by Poseidon in hollow caves.
Indeed, from that time the earth-shaker Poseidon did not
kill Odysseus, but he turned him away from his father's land.
But come now!  Let all of us here think on 
his home-coming, how he might arrive; and Poseidon will let go
of his wrath; for he won't be strong enough to contend alone
against against the will of all the immortal gods."
========================================

τὸν δ᾽ ἠμείβετ᾽ ἔπειτα θεά, γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη:   80
‘ὦ πάτερ ἡμέτερε Κρονίδη, ὕπατε κρειόντων,

ἠδ᾽ ἵνα μιν κλέος ἐσθλὸν ἐν ἀνθρώποισιν ἔχῃσιν.’
========================================

Then the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, answered him:
"O father, son of Cronos, our highest lord,
if this truly is welcome to the blessed gods,
that wily Odysseus should return to his home,
then let us speed the messenger Hermes, the slayer of Argus,
to the isle of Ogygia, to promptly
tell the fair-haired nymph the final judgment,
the home-coming of stout-hearted Odysseus, that he should return home:
but I'll go to Ithaca myself, to get his son
all riled up and put purpose in his heart,
to summon the people, the long-haired Achaeans, into the market-place
and to speak to all the suitors, who are always slaughtering
his thronging sheep and his lumbering crimped-horned oxen.
and I'll send him to both Sparta and to sandy Pylos -
to ask about the return of his dear father, and if he should hear anything,
may he there have his good report among men."
========================================

ὣς εἰποῦσ᾽ ὑπὸ ποσσὶν ἐδήσατο καλὰ πέδιλα,
ἀμβρόσια χρύσεια, τά μιν φέρον ἠμὲν ἐφ᾽ ὑγρὴν
ἠδ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ἀπείρονα γαῖαν ἅμα πνοιῇς ἀνέμοιο:

========================================

After she said this she bound her feet in beautiful sandals,
divine and golden, which would carry her upon both sea
and boundless earth, swift as a blast of wind:
she grasped a stout spear, tipped with sharp bronze,
large, heavy, and sturdy, with which she subdues the ranks of any hero-men
that this daughter of a mighty sire might be angry with.
She darted out and stepped down from Olympus' peaks,
and came to a stop in the land of Ithaca at Odysseus' door,
at the threshold of his courtyard; in her hand she carried her spear of bronze,
appearing as a stranger, Mentes, the king of the Taphians.
And there she found the arrogant suitors. They were
cheering their spirits, playing checkers in front of the doors
sitting on the hides of oxen that they themselves had killed;
And their heralds and their busy servants,
some were mixing wine and water in bowls
while some washed the tables with porous sponges
and set them, and some distributed much meat.
========================================
τὴν δὲ πολὺ πρῶτος ἴδε Τηλέμαχος θεοειδής,
ἧστο γὰρ ἐν μνηστῆρσι φίλον τετιημένος ἦτορ,

καί μιν φωνήσας ἔπεα πτερόεντα προσηύδα:
‘χαῖρε, ξεῖνε, παρ᾽ ἄμμι φιλήσεαι: αὐτὰρ ἔπειτα

ὣς εἰπὼν ἡγεῖθ᾽, ἡ δ᾽ ἕσπετο Παλλὰς Ἀθήνη.   125
οἱ δ᾽ ὅτε δή ῥ᾽ ἔντοσθεν ἔσαν δόμου ὑψηλοῖο,

ἔγχε᾽ Ὀδυσσῆος ταλασίφρονος ἵστατο πολλά,
αὐτὴν δ᾽ ἐς θρόνον εἷσεν ἄγων, ὑπὸ λῖτα πετάσσας,   130
καλὸν δαιδάλεον: ὑπὸ δὲ θρῆνυς ποσὶν ἦεν.
========================================

The godlike Telemachus was by far the first to see her,
for he'd sat among the suitors, grieving in his dear heart,
seeing his brave father in his minds eye, if only he'd come from somewhere
and send the suitors scattering from the house,
he'd have honor and be master over his own house.
Minded of this, while he sat with the suitors, he saw Athena.
he walked straight to the doorway, ashamed in his soul
that a stranger had waited so long at the door: he stopped beside her,
grasped her right hand and took the bronze spear,
and addressed her, uttering winged words:
"Greetings, stranger, you're welcome in our house: and when
you've had some dinner you'll tell of what you need."
When he'd spoken thus he led the way, and Pallas Athena followed.
As soon as they were inside the lofty house,
he stood the spear that he was carrying in a spear-case
of polished metal near a tall pillar, where many 
other spears of stout-hearted Odysseus stood.
He led her to a chair and seated her, spreading a linen cloth beneath,
the chair was beautifully wrought: with a footstool for her feet under it.
========================================

πὰρ δ᾽ αὐτὸς κλισμὸν θέτο ποικίλον, ἔκτοθεν ἄλλων
μνηστήρων, μὴ ξεῖνος ἀνιηθεὶς ὀρυμαγδῷ

ἠδ᾽ ἵνα μιν περὶ πατρὸς ἀποιχομένοιο ἔροιτο.   135

τοῖσι δὲ κήρυκες μὲν ὕδωρ ἐπὶ χεῖρας ἔχευαν,
σῖτον δὲ δμῳαὶ παρενήνεον ἐν κανέοισιν,
========================================

He himself sat on an inlaid couch beside her, far from
the suitors, lest his guest should loathe the meal,
bothered by the din of the proud boys who had come,
and to let him ask about his absent father.
A handmaiden brought water in an elegant gold ewer
and poured it out over a silver basin for washing their hands,
and set out a planed table beside them.
The respectable housekeeper brought bread and set it before them.
She set many dishes down, giving freely of what she had.
The carver picked up trenchers of all sorts of meats and set them down.
He set golden goblets by their side, while
a herald often came up to them, pouring out wine.
The arrogant suitors came in, and then 
sat down, one after the other, on the couches and chairs.
Heralds poured water over their hands,
handmaidens heaped bread into baskets,
and boys filled drinking vessels.
========================================
οἱ δ᾽ ἐπ᾽ ὀνείαθ᾽ ἑτοῖμα προκείμενα χεῖρας ἴαλλον.

========================================
They put their hands out to the food that had been cooked and set before them.
After the suitors had sated themselves on food and drink,
they turned their hearts to other things,
to song and dance: for these are a banquet's delights:
a herald placed a beautiful lyre into Phemius' hands,
who was forced to sing for the suitors.
And he took the harp and struck up a beautiful song.
But Telemachus addressed Athena of the gleaming eyes,
holding his head close, for fear the others might notice:
"Dear stranger, will you be mad at me for what I say?
These men care for these things, playing the lyre and singing,
lightly, while they, without recompense, eat up the livelihood of another man,
whose bleached bones are decaying somewhere, lying on the ground
in the rain, or rolled by the waves in the sea.
========================================
εἰ κεῖνόν γ᾽ Ἰθάκηνδε ἰδοίατο νοστήσαντα,

========================================
If they should see that man on his way to Ithaca,
they'd all pray to be lighter on their feet 
rather than richer in gold and clothing.
But now he has thus been foully doomed to die, and with
no comfort for us, even if any man on earth
should say that he will come: the day of his home-coming is lost.
But come, tell me this and recount it truly:
Who are you among men, and from where? Where is your city and your parents?
And what sort of ship did you arrive on: How did the sailors
bring you to Ithaca?  Who did they profess to be?
For I don't think that you came here on foot.
Tell me this truly, so that I might know it well,
are you just now visiting, or are you my father's friend,
since many others have been coming to our house,
since he also was wandering in the world of men."
========================================

========================================

And the goddess, Athena of the gleaming eyes, spoke to him again:
"Well then, I will tell you these things with absolute exactness.
I declare that I am Mentes, the son of warlike Anchialus,
and I am lord to the Taphians, who are fond of the oar.
So I have now come with a ship and my companions,
sailing on the wine-colored sea to where men talk strangely,
I carry glittering iron to Temese, looking for copper.
My ship has put in by a field far from town,
in Reithron Harbor, under the woods of Neion.
I proclaim that we are friends, as our families have been
from the start. If you were to go and ask the old hero Leartes,
whom (they say) no longer sets out for town,
but endures miseries far away in the country
with an old waiting-woman. She serves him both meat and drink
whenever weariness takes hold of his limbs,
as he creeps up the slope of his vinyard.
========================================
νῦν δ᾽ ἦλθον: δὴ γάρ μιν ἔφαντ᾽ ἐπιδήμιον εἶναι,
σὸν πατέρ᾽: ἀλλά νυ τόν γε θεοὶ βλάπτουσι κελεύθου.   195
οὐ γάρ πω τέθνηκεν ἐπὶ χθονὶ δῖος Ὀδυσσεύς,
ἀλλ᾽ ἔτι που ζωὸς κατερύκεται εὐρέι πόντῳ
νήσῳ ἐν ἀμφιρύτῃ, χαλεποὶ δέ μιν ἄνδρες ἔχουσιν
ἄγριοι, οἵ που κεῖνον ἐρυκανόωσ᾽ ἀέκοντα.
αὐτὰρ νῦν τοι ἐγὼ μαντεύσομαι, ὡς ἐνὶ θυμῷ   200
ἀθάνατοι βάλλουσι καὶ ὡς τελέεσθαι ὀίω,
οὔτε τι μάντις ἐὼν οὔτ᾽ οἰωνῶν σάφα εἰδώς.
οὔ τοι ἔτι δηρόν γε φίλης ἀπὸ πατρίδος αἴης
ἔσσεται, οὐδ᾽ εἴ πέρ τε σιδήρεα δέσματ᾽ ἔχῃσιν:
φράσσεται ὥς κε νέηται, ἐπεὶ πολυμήχανός ἐστιν.   205
ἀλλ᾽ ἄγε μοι τόδε εἰπὲ καὶ ἀτρεκέως κατάλεξον,
εἰ δὴ ἐξ αὐτοῖο τόσος πάϊς εἰς Ὀδυσῆος.
========================================

Now I have come: for indeed they said that he was at home,
your father, that is.  But now the gods are blocking his journey.
For the illustrious Odysseus has not yet died upon the earth,
but still lives somewhere. He is detained on a seagirt island
by the wide sea, fierce, savage men hold him back,
they, I think, restrain that unwilling man.
Nevertheless I'll now prophesy to you, as the immortals
cast in my heart and as I think it will come about,
though I am not a seer, nor do I know the truth of auguries.
Not much longer will he be away from you and from his beloved fatherland,
not even if iron fetters should hold him -
he'll think up a way to get here, since he's a wily one.
But come, tell me this, and truthfully recount,
if indeed, being so tall, you yourself are Odysseus' son.
========================================
αἰνῶς μὲν κεφαλήν τε καὶ ὄμματα καλὰ ἔοικας
κείνῳ, ἐπεὶ θαμὰ τοῖον ἐμισγόμεθ᾽ ἀλλήλοισιν,

πρίν γε τὸν ἐς Τροίην ἀναβήμεναι, ἔνθα περ ἄλλοι   210
Ἀργείων οἱ ἄριστοι ἔβαν κοίλῃς ἐνὶ νηυσίν:

ἐκ τοῦ δ᾽ οὔτ᾽ Ὀδυσῆα ἐγὼν ἴδον οὔτ᾽ ἔμ᾽ ἐκεῖνος.’
τὴν δ᾽ αὖ Τηλέμαχος πεπνυμένος ἀντίον ηὔδα:

‘τοιγὰρ ἐγώ τοι, ξεῖνε, μάλ᾽ ἀτρεκέως ἀγορεύσω.
μήτηρ μέν τέ μέ φησι τοῦ ἔμμεναι, αὐτὰρ ἐγώ γε   215

οὐκ οἶδ᾽: οὐ γάρ πώ τις ἑὸν γόνον αὐτὸς ἀνέγνω.
ὡς δὴ ἐγώ γ᾽ ὄφελον μάκαρός νύ τευ ἔμμεναι υἱὸς

.. ἀνέρος, ὃν κτεάτεσσιν ἑοῖς ἔπι γῆρας ἔτετμε.
νῦν δ᾽ ὃς ἀποτμότατος γένετο θνητῶν ἀνθρώπων,

.. τοῦ μ᾽ ἔκ φασι γενέσθαι, ἐπεὶ σύ με τοῦτ᾽ ἐρεείνεις.’    220
========================================
Indeed, in your head and your handsome eyes you have looked very much like
that man, when we so often mixed it up with each other,

at least until he went up to Troy, there other men,
the best of the Argives, walked into the hollow ship:

from that time on I saw not Odysseus, nor he me."
again Telemachus in full possession of himself was speaking facing her:

"Well, then, stranger, I'll tell you precisely.
Indeed my mother told me of the/him/it to be, yet I at least

have not known: for not yet someone >his own child he himself knows.
As indeed I at least was obliged of happy now of anyone to be the son

of the man, old age overtook him upon his possessions.
And now this ill-starred man has become of mortal men,

of him from me they say that he has become, since/when you ask me these things."
