<h4>Acts 21</h4>

<p>
<!--
[1] Ὡς δὲ ἐγένετο ἀναχθῆναι ἡμᾶς ἀποσπασθέντας ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, 
εὐθυδρομήσαντες ἤλθομεν εἰς τὴν Κῶ, τῇ δὲ ἑξῆς εἰς τὴν Ῥόδον,
κἀκεῖθεν εἰς Πάταρα.
-->
  But as it happened, we were drawn away from them to put to sea,
  and sailed directly to Cos, and then on to Rhodes the next day,
  and from there to Patara.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[2] καὶ εὑρόντες πλοῖον διαπερῶν εἰς Φοινίκην ἐπιβάντες ἀνήχθημεν.
-->
  And finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we boarded it and set sail.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[3] ἀναφάναντες δὲ τὴν Κύπρον καὶ καταλιπόντες αὐτὴν εὐώνυμον ἐπλέομεν εἰς
 Συρίαν, καὶ κατήλθομεν εἰς Τύρον, 
ἐκεῖσε γὰρ τὸ πλοῖον ἦν ἀποφορτιζόμενον τὸν γόμον.
-->
  But after sighting Cyprus and passing it on the port side
  we sailed to Syria and came to harbor at Tyre,
  for that was where the ship was unloading its cargo.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[4] ἀνευρόντες δὲ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἐπεμείναμεν αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας ἑπτά,
 οἵτινες τῷ Παύλῳ ἔλεγον διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος μὴ ἐπιβαίνειν εἰς Ἰεροσόλυμα.
-->
  We stayed there for seven days after finding the disciples,
  and they, speaking through the spirit of God,
  told Paul not to embark for Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[5] ὅτε δὲ ἐγένετο ἐξαρτίσαι ἡμᾶς τὰς ἡμέρας,
ἐξελθόντες ἐπορευόμεθα προπεμπόντων ἡμᾶς πάντων σὺν γυναιξὶ καὶ τέκνοις ἕως ἔξω
τῆς πόλεως,
καὶ θέντες τὰ γόνατα ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν προσευξάμενοι
-->
  And when it came about that we'd finished our days,
  we departed and travelled on,
  with all those accompanying us with wives and children until out of the city,
  and then we knelt on the shore and offered up prayers.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[6] ἀπησπασάμεθα ἀλλήλους, καὶ ἐνέβημεν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον,
ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς τὰ ἴδια.
-->
  We took leave of each other, and we boarded the ship,
  while they returned to their own homes.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[7] Ἡμεῖς δὲ τὸν πλοῦν διανύσαντες ἀπὸ Τύρου κατηντήσαμεν εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα,
καὶ ἀσπασάμενοι τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἐμείναμεν ἡμέραν μίαν παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς.
-->
  And when we'd ended our sea-voyage from Tyre we reached Ptolemais,
  and after greeting our brothers we stayed one day with them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[8] τῇ δὲ ἐπαύριον ἐξελθόντες ἤλθαμεν εἰς Καισαρίαν,
καὶ εἰσελθόντες εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φιλίππου τοῦ εὐαγγελιστοῦ ὄντος ἐκ τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐμείναμεν παρ᾽ αὐτῷ.
-->
  And on the next day we left there and set out for Caesarea,
  and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, 
  one of the seven, and stayed with him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[9] τούτῳ δὲ ἦσαν θυγατέρες τέσσαρες παρθένοι προφητεύουσαι.
-->
   Now this man had four maiden daughters who prophesied.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[10] Ἐπιμενόντων δὲ ἡμέρας πλείους κατῆλθέν τις ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας προφήτης
ὀνόματι Ἄγαβος,
-->
  And while we were staying for some days a prophet, named Agabus,
  came from Judea.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[11] καὶ ἐλθὼν πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ ἄρας τὴν ζώνην τοῦ Παύλου δήσας ἑαυτοῦ τοὺς πόδας
 καὶ τὰς χεῖρας εἶπεν Τάδε λέγει τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον Τὸν ἄνδρα οὗ ἐστὶν ἡ ζώνη
 αὕτη οὕτως δήσουσιν ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ παραδώσουσιν εἰς χεῖρας
ἐθνῶν.
-->
  And when he came to us he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet
  and hands and said, "The Holy Spirit says this:
  In Jerusalem, the Jews will bind the man whose belt this is in this way,
  and they will hand him over into the hands of Gentiles.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[12] ὡς δὲ ἠκούσαμεν ταῦτα, παρεκαλοῦμεν ἡμεῖς τε καὶ οἱ ἐντόπιοι τοῦ μὴ ἀναβαίνειν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ.
-->
  And when we heard this, both we and the local men urged him
  not to go to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[13]
τότε ἀπεκρίθη [ὁ] Παῦλος Τί ποιεῖτε κλαίοντες καὶ συνθρύπτοντές μου τὴν καρδίαν;
ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐ μόνον δεθῆναι ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀποθανεῖν εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἑτοίμως ἔχω ὑπὲρ τοῦ
ὀνόματος τοῦ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ.
-->
  Then Paul replied, "What you are doing, crying and breaking my heart?
  For I am ready not only to be bound but even to be killed
  in Jerusalem for the sake of the name of our lord Jesus."
</p>

<p>
<!--
[14] μὴ πειθομένου δὲ αὐτοῦ ἡσυχάσαμεν εἰπόντες Τοῦ κυρίου τὸ θέλημα γινέσθω.
-->
  And when he was not persuaded we fell silent, saying:
  "Let the Lord's will be done."
</p>

<p>
<!--
[15] Μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας ἐπισκευασάμενοι ἀνεβαίνομεν εἰς Ἰεροσόλυμα:
-->
  After those days we got ready and went to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[16] συνῆλθον δὲ καὶ τῶν μαθητῶν ἀπὸ Καισαρίας σὺν ἡμῖν,
ἄγοντες παρ᾽ ᾧ ξενισθῶμεν Μνάσωνί τινι Κυπρίῳ, ἀρχαίῳ μαθητῇ.
-->
  And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us too,
  bringing along a certain Mnason, a Cypriate,
  a long-time disciple with whom we could stay.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[17] Γενομένων δὲ ἡμῶν εἰς Ἰεροσόλυμα ἀσμένως ἀπεδέξαντο ἡμᾶς οἱ ἀδελφοί.
-->
  And when we reached Jerusalem the brothers welcomed us joyfully.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[18] τῇ δὲ ἐπιούσῃ εἰσῄει ὁ Παῦλος σὺν ἡμῖν πρὸς Ἰάκωβον,
πάντες τε παρεγένοντο οἱ πρεσβύτεροι.
-->
  And on the next day, Paul went with us to James, and all the elders were there.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[19] καὶ ἀσπασάμενος αὐτοὺς ἐξηγεῖτο καθ᾽ ἓν ἕκαστον
ὧν ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν διὰ τῆς διακονίας αὐτοῦ.
-->
  And after greeting them he explained in turn each of the things
  God had done among the nations through his ministry. 
</p>

<p>
<!--
[20] οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες ἐδόξαζον τὸν θεόν, εἶπάν τε αὐτῷ Θεωρεῖς, ἀδελφέ,
πόσαι μυριάδες εἰσὶν ἐν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τῶν πεπιστευκότων,
καὶ πάντες ζηλωταὶ τοῦ νόμου ὑπάρχουσιν: 
-->
  Those who heard him praised God, and they said to him,
  "You see, brother, how many myriads of the faithful there are among the Jews,
  and they are all followers of the law.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[21] κατηχήθησαν δὲ περὶ σοῦ
ὅτι ἀποστασίαν διδάσκεις ἀπὸ Μωυσέως τοὺς κατὰ τὰ ἔθνη πάντας Ἰουδαίους,
λέγων μὴ περιτέμνειν αὐτοὺς τὰ τέκνα μηδὲ τοῖς ἔθεσιν περιπατεῖν.
-->
  They've been told about you
  that you teach all the Jews throughout the nations to revolt from Moses,
  telling them not to circumcise their children
  and not to walk according to the customs.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[22] τί οὖν ἐστίν; πάντως ἀκούσονται ὅτι ἐλήλυθας.
-->
  And so what is it?
  They will certainly hear that you have come.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[23] τοῦτο οὖν ποίησον ὅ σοι λέγομεν:
εἰσὶν ἡμῖν ἄνδρες τέσσαρες εὐχὴν ἔχοντες ἀφ᾽ ἑαυτῶν.
-->
  So do what we tell you:
  we have four men who have laid a vow on themselves.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[24] τούτους παραλαβὼν ἁγνίσθητι σὺν αὐτοῖς
καὶ δαπάνησον ἐπ᾽ αὐτοῖς ἵνα ξυρήσονται τὴν κεφαλήν,
καὶ γνώσονται πάντες ὅτι ὧν κατήχηνται περὶ σοῦ οὐδὲν ἔστιν,
ἀλλὰ στοιχεῖς καὶ αὐτὸς φυλάσσων τὸν νόμον.
-->
  Take these men and purify yourself with them
  and pay for them to shave their heads,
  and everyone will realize that what they have been told about you is nothing,
  but that you yourself are following and keeping the law.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[25] περὶ δὲ τῶν πεπιστευκότων ἐθνῶν
ἡμεῖς ἀπεστείλαμεν κρίναντες φυλάσσεσθαι αὐτοὺς τό τε εἰδωλόθυτον
καὶ αἷμα καὶ πνικτὸν καὶ πορνείαν.
-->
  Concerning the Gentiles who are believers, we have sent off a letter,
  after deciding that they should keep away from this (circumcision?),
  as well as meats offered to idols, blood, strangled things and fornication.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[26] τότε ὁ Παῦλος παραλαβὼν τοὺς ἄνδρας τῇ ἐχομένῃ ἡμέρᾳ σὺν αὐτοῖς ἁγνισθεὶς
εἰσῄει εἰς τὸ ἱερόν, διαγγέλλων τὴν ἐκπλήρωσιν
“τῶν ἡμερῶν τοῦ ἁγνισμοῦ” ἕως οὗ προσηνέχθη ὑπὲρ ἑνὸς ἑκάστου αὐτῶν ἡ προσφορά.
-->
  Then Paul took the men and, on the following day, was purified with them
  and entered the temple, proclaiming the fulfillment
  "of the days of the purification"
  until the offering of each of them was offered.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[27] Ὡς δὲ ἔμελλον αἱ ἑπτὰ ἡμέραι συντελεῖσθαι,
οἱ ἀπὸ τῆς Ἀσίας Ἰουδαῖοι θεασάμενοι αὐτὸν ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ συνέχεον
πάντα τὸν ὄχλον καὶ ἐπέβαλαν ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν τὰς χεῖρας,
-->
  As the seven days were about to come to an end,
  the Jews from Asia who saw him in the temple stirred the whole crowd up
  and laid their hands on him,
</p>

<p>
<!--
[28] κράζοντες Ἄνδρες Ἰσραηλεῖται, βοηθεῖτε:
οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ ἄνθρωπος ὁ κατὰ τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ τοῦ νόμου καὶ τοῦ τόπου τούτου πάντας πανταχῇ διδάσκων,
ἔτι τε καὶ Ἕλληνας εἰσήγαγεν εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν καὶ κεκοίνωκεν τὸν ἅγιον τόπον τοῦτον.
-->
  crying out: "Israelite men! Help us!
  This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere
  contrary to the people and the law and this place.
  What's more,
  he also brought Greeks into the temple and defiled this holy place."
</p>

<p>
<!--
[29] ἦσαν γὰρ προεωρακότες Τρόφιμον τὸν Ἐφέσιον ἐν τῇ πόλει σὺν αὐτῷ,
ὃν ἐνόμιζον ὅτι εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν εἰσήγαγεν ὁ Παῦλος.
-->
  For, since they'd seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him,
  they thought that Paul had brought him into the temple.

[30] ἐκινήθη τε ἡ πόλις ὅλη καὶ ἐγένετο συνδρομὴ τοῦ λαοῦ,
καὶ ἐπιλαβόμενοι τοῦ Παύλου εἷλκον αὐτὸν ἔξω τοῦ ἱεροῦ,
καὶ εὐθέως ἐκλείσθησαν αἱ θύραι.
-->
  The whole city was in an uproar and the people ran together tumultuously,
  and the men who had laid hold of Paul dragged him out of the temple,
  and the doors were shut.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[31] Ζητούντων τε αὐτὸν ἀποκτεῖναι ἀνέβη φάσις τῷ χιλιάρχῳ τῆς σπείρης
ὅτι ὅλη συνχύννεται Ἰερουσαλήμ,
-->
  And while they sought to kill him
  a report went up to the captain of the cohort
  that all of Jerusalem was stirred up,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[32] ὃς ἐξαυτῆς παραλαβὼν στρατιώτας καὶ ἑκατοντάρχας κατέδραμεν ἐπ᾽ αὐτούς,
οἱ δὲ ἰδόντες τὸν χιλίαρχον καὶ τοὺς στρατιώτας ἐπαύσαντο τύπτοντες τὸν Παῦλον.
-->
  He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down upon them,
  and when they saw the captain and the soldiers they stopped beating Paul.

<!--
[33] τότε ἐγγίσας ὁ χιλίαρχος ἐπελάβετο αὐτοῦ καὶ ἐκέλευσε δεθῆναι ἁλύσεσι δυσί,

-->
  Then the captain approached and took hold of him and ordered him to be bound
  with two chains, and asked who he was and what he was doing:
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[34] ἄλλοι δὲ ἄλλο τι ἐπεφώνουν ἐν τῷ ὄχλῳ:
μὴ δυναμένου δὲ αὐτοῦ γνῶναι τὸ ἀσφαλὲς διὰ τὸν θόρυβον ἐκέλευσεν ἄγεσθαι αὐτὸν
εἰς τὴν παρεμβολήν.
-->
  and some in the crowd said some other thing:
  so that he couldn't learn anything for sure because of the noise,
  so he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[35] ὅτε δὲ ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀναβαθμούς,
συνέβη βαστάζεσθαι αὐτὸν ὑπὸ τῶν στρατιωτῶν διὰ τὴν βίαν τοῦ ὄχλου,

  And when it happened upon the steps,
  he stood with feet together for him to be carried off by the soldiers
  because of the violence of the mob,
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[36] ἠκολούθει γὰρ τὸ πλῆθος τοῦ λαοῦ κράζοντες Αἶρε αὐτόν.

  "Take him away!"
