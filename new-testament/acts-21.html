<h4>Acts 21</h4>

<p>
<!--
[1] Ὡς δὲ ἐγένετο ἀναχθῆναι ἡμᾶς ἀποσπασθέντας ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, 
εὐθυδρομήσαντες ἤλθομεν εἰς τὴν Κῶ, τῇ δὲ ἑξῆς εἰς τὴν Ῥόδον,
κἀκεῖθεν εἰς Πάταρα.
-->
  But as it happened, we were drawn away from them to put to sea,
  and sailed directly to Cos, and then on to Rhodes the next day,
  and from there to Patara.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[2] καὶ εὑρόντες πλοῖον διαπερῶν εἰς Φοινίκην ἐπιβάντες ἀνήχθημεν.
-->
  And finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we boarded it and set sail.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[3] ἀναφάναντες δὲ τὴν Κύπρον καὶ καταλιπόντες αὐτὴν εὐώνυμον ἐπλέομεν εἰς
 Συρίαν, καὶ κατήλθομεν εἰς Τύρον, 
ἐκεῖσε γὰρ τὸ πλοῖον ἦν ἀποφορτιζόμενον τὸν γόμον.
-->
  But after sighting Cyprus and passing it on the port side
  we sailed to Syria and came to harbor at Tyre,
  for that was where the ship was unloading its cargo.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[4] ἀνευρόντες δὲ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἐπεμείναμεν αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας ἑπτά,
 οἵτινες τῷ Παύλῳ ἔλεγον διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος μὴ ἐπιβαίνειν εἰς Ἰεροσόλυμα.
-->
  We stayed there for seven days after finding the disciples,
  and they, speaking through the spirit of God,
  told Paul not to embark for Jerusalem.
</p>

<!--
[5] ὅτε δὲ ἐγένετο ἐξαρτίσαι ἡμᾶς τὰς ἡμέρας,
ἐξελθόντες ἐπορευόμεθα προπεμπόντων ἡμᾶς πάντων σὺν γυναιξὶ καὶ τέκνοις ἕως ἔξω
τῆς πόλεως,
καὶ θέντες τὰ γόνατα ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν προσευξάμενοι
-->
  indeed when it happened to have finished >us >the days,
  we having gone we were carried of all those sent before us with wives
  and children until I might have sent out of the city,
  and those who had put their knees on the shore having offered prayers
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[6] ἀπησπασάμεθα ἀλλήλους, καὶ ἐνέβημεν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον,
ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς τὰ ἴδια.
-->
  we greeted each other, and we stepped in to the ship,
  those men indeed turned round about to their private interests.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[7] Ἡμεῖς δὲ τὸν πλοῦν διανύσαντες ἀπὸ Τύρου κατηντήσαμεν εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα,
καὶ ἀσπασάμενοι τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἐμείναμεν ἡμέραν μίαν παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς.
-->
  Indeed we >the ship having accomplished by Tyre we came opposite into
  Ptolema..,
  and having greeted the brothers we stayed one day beside them.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[8] τῇ δὲ ἐπαύριον ἐξελθόντες ἤλθαμεν εἰς Καισαρίαν,
καὶ εἰσελθόντες εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φιλίππου τοῦ εὐαγγελιστοῦ ὄντος ἐκ τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐμείναμεν παρ᾽ αὐτῷ.
-->
  indeed here on the next day having gone we set out to Caesarian,
  and having entered the house of Philip the evangelist who was/is
  from out of the seven we stayed beside him.
</p>
