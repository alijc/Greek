<h4>Acts 21</h4>

<p>
<!--
[1] Ὡς δὲ ἐγένετο ἀναχθῆναι ἡμᾶς ἀποσπασθέντας ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν, 
εὐθυδρομήσαντες ἤλθομεν εἰς τὴν Κῶ, τῇ δὲ ἑξῆς εἰς τὴν Ῥόδον,
κἀκεῖθεν εἰς Πάταρα.
-->
  But as it happened, we were drawn away from them to put to sea,
  and sailed directly to Cos, and then on to Rhodes the next day,
  and from there to Patara.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[2] καὶ εὑρόντες πλοῖον διαπερῶν εἰς Φοινίκην ἐπιβάντες ἀνήχθημεν.
-->
  And finding a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we boarded it and set sail.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[3] ἀναφάναντες δὲ τὴν Κύπρον καὶ καταλιπόντες αὐτὴν εὐώνυμον ἐπλέομεν εἰς
 Συρίαν, καὶ κατήλθομεν εἰς Τύρον, 
ἐκεῖσε γὰρ τὸ πλοῖον ἦν ἀποφορτιζόμενον τὸν γόμον.
-->
  But after sighting Cyprus and passing it on the port side
  we sailed to Syria and came to harbor at Tyre,
  for that was where the ship was unloading its cargo.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[4] ἀνευρόντες δὲ τοὺς μαθητὰς ἐπεμείναμεν αὐτοῦ ἡμέρας ἑπτά,
 οἵτινες τῷ Παύλῳ ἔλεγον διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος μὴ ἐπιβαίνειν εἰς Ἰεροσόλυμα.
-->
  We stayed there for seven days after finding the disciples,
  and they, speaking through the spirit of God,
  told Paul not to embark for Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[5] ὅτε δὲ ἐγένετο ἐξαρτίσαι ἡμᾶς τὰς ἡμέρας,
ἐξελθόντες ἐπορευόμεθα προπεμπόντων ἡμᾶς πάντων σὺν γυναιξὶ καὶ τέκνοις ἕως ἔξω
τῆς πόλεως,
καὶ θέντες τὰ γόνατα ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν προσευξάμενοι
-->
  And when it came about that we'd finished our days,
  we departed and travelled on,
  with all those accompanying us with wives and children until out of the city,
  and then we knelt on the shore and offered up prayers.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[6] ἀπησπασάμεθα ἀλλήλους, καὶ ἐνέβημεν εἰς τὸ πλοῖον,
ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς τὰ ἴδια.
-->
  We took leave of each other, and we boarded the ship,
  while they returned to their own homes.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[7] Ἡμεῖς δὲ τὸν πλοῦν διανύσαντες ἀπὸ Τύρου κατηντήσαμεν εἰς Πτολεμαΐδα,
καὶ ἀσπασάμενοι τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ἐμείναμεν ἡμέραν μίαν παρ᾽ αὐτοῖς.
-->
  And when we'd ended our sea-voyage from Tyre we reached Ptolemais,
  and after greeting our brothers we stayed one day with them.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[8] τῇ δὲ ἐπαύριον ἐξελθόντες ἤλθαμεν εἰς Καισαρίαν,
καὶ εἰσελθόντες εἰς τὸν οἶκον Φιλίππου τοῦ εὐαγγελιστοῦ ὄντος ἐκ τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐμείναμεν παρ᾽ αὐτῷ.
-->
  And on the next day we left there and set out for Caesarea,
  and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, 
  one of the seven, and stayed with him.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[9] τούτῳ δὲ ἦσαν θυγατέρες τέσσαρες παρθένοι προφητεύουσαι.
-->
   Now this man had four maiden daughters who prophesied.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[10] Ἐπιμενόντων δὲ ἡμέρας πλείους κατῆλθέν τις ἀπὸ τῆς Ἰουδαίας προφήτης
ὀνόματι Ἄγαβος,
-->
  And while we were staying for some days a prophet, named Agabus,
  came from Judea.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[11] καὶ ἐλθὼν πρὸς ἡμᾶς καὶ ἄρας τὴν ζώνην τοῦ Παύλου δήσας ἑαυτοῦ τοὺς πόδας
 καὶ τὰς χεῖρας εἶπεν Τάδε λέγει τὸ πνεῦμα τὸ ἅγιον Τὸν ἄνδρα οὗ ἐστὶν ἡ ζώνη
 αὕτη οὕτως δήσουσιν ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ παραδώσουσιν εἰς χεῖρας
ἐθνῶν.
-->
  And when he came to us he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet
  and hands and said, "The Holy Spirit says this:
  In Jerusalem, the Jews will bind the man whose belt this is in this way,
  and they will hand him over into the hands of Gentiles.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[12] ὡς δὲ ἠκούσαμεν ταῦτα, παρεκαλοῦμεν ἡμεῖς τε καὶ οἱ ἐντόπιοι τοῦ μὴ ἀναβαίνειν αὐτὸν εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ.
-->
  And when we heard this, both we and the local men urged him
  not to go to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[13]
τότε ἀπεκρίθη [ὁ] Παῦλος Τί ποιεῖτε κλαίοντες καὶ συνθρύπτοντές μου τὴν καρδίαν;
ἐγὼ γὰρ οὐ μόνον δεθῆναι ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀποθανεῖν εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἑτοίμως ἔχω ὑπὲρ τοῦ
ὀνόματος τοῦ κυρίου Ἰησοῦ.
-->
  Then Paul replied, "What you are doing, crying and breaking my heart?
  For I am ready not only to be bound but even to be killed
  in Jerusalem for the sake of the name of our lord Jesus."
</p>

<p>
<!--
[14] μὴ πειθομένου δὲ αὐτοῦ ἡσυχάσαμεν εἰπόντες Τοῦ κυρίου τὸ θέλημα γινέσθω.
-->
  And when he was not persuaded we fell silent, saying:
  "Let the Lord's will be done."
</p>

<p>
<!--
[15] Μετὰ δὲ τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας ἐπισκευασάμενοι ἀνεβαίνομεν εἰς Ἰεροσόλυμα:
-->
  After those days we got ready and went to Jerusalem.
</p>

<p>
<!--
[16] συνῆλθον δὲ καὶ τῶν μαθητῶν ἀπὸ Καισαρίας σὺν ἡμῖν,
ἄγοντες παρ᾽ ᾧ ξενισθῶμεν Μνάσωνί τινι Κυπρίῳ, ἀρχαίῳ μαθητῇ.
-->
  And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us too,
  bringing along a certain Mnason, a Cypriate,
  a long-time disciple with whom we could stay.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[17] Γενομένων δὲ ἡμῶν εἰς Ἰεροσόλυμα ἀσμένως ἀπεδέξαντο ἡμᾶς οἱ ἀδελφοί.
-->
  And when we were in Jerusalem the brothers welcomed us joyfully.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[18] τῇ δὲ ἐπιούσῃ εἰσῄει ὁ Παῦλος σὺν ἡμῖν πρὸς Ἰάκωβον,
πάντες τε παρεγένοντο οἱ πρεσβύτεροι.
-->
  And on the next day, us and Paul visited James, and all the elders were there.
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[19] καὶ ἀσπασάμενος αὐτοὺς ἐξηγεῖτο καθ᾽ ἓν ἕκαστον
ὧν ἐποίησεν ὁ θεὸς ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν διὰ τῆς διακονίας αὐτοῦ.
-->
  And after greeting them he explained in turn each of the things
  God did among the nations through his ministry. 
</p>

<p>AJC
<!--
[20] οἱ δὲ ἀκούσαντες ἐδόξαζον τὸν θεόν, εἶπάν τε αὐτῷ Θεωρεῖς, ἀδελφέ,
πόσαι μυριάδες εἰσὶν ἐν τοῖς Ἰουδαίοις τῶν πεπιστευκότων,
καὶ πάντες ζηλωταὶ τοῦ νόμου ὑπάρχουσιν: 
-->
  Those who heard him praised God, and they said to him,
  "You see, brother, how many myriads of the faithful there are among the Jews,
  and they are all followers of the law.

ὅτι ἀποστασίαν διδάσκεις ἀπὸ Μωυσέως τοὺς κατὰ τὰ ἔθνη πάντας Ἰουδαίους,
