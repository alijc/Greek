I.1.
Δαρείου καὶ Παρυσάτιδος γίγνονται παῖδες δύο, πρεσβύτερος μὲν Ἀρταξέρξης,
νεώτερος δὲ Κῦρος· ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠσθένει Δαρεῖος καὶ ὑπώπτευε τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου,
ἐβούλετο τὼ παῖδε ἀμφοτέρω παρεῖναι.

To Darius and Parysatis were born two sons, the elder Artaxerxes,
and the younger Cyrus. Now when Darius was ill and felt his death near,
he wanted both children to be present.


2. ὁ μὲν οὖν πρεσβύτερος παρὼν ἐτύγχανε·
Κῦρον δὲ μεταπέμπεται ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἧς αὐτὸν σατράπην ἐποίησε,
καὶ στρατηγὸν δὲ αὐτὸν ἀπέδειξε πάντων ὅσοι ἐς Καστωλοῦ πεδίον ἁθροίζονται.
ἀναβαίνει οὖν ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν Τισσαφέρνην ὡς φίλον,
καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἔχων ὁπλίτας ἀνέβη τριακοσίους,
ἄρχοντα δὲ αὐτῶν Ξενίαν Παρράσιον.

Now the elder son happened to be at hand then,
but he sent for Cyrus from the region that he had made him satrap of,
and had also appointed him general of all those who muster at Castolus’ Plain.
Cyrus then embarked, taking along Tissaphernes as his friend,
and three hundred of the Greek hoplites and their commander Xenias of Parrhasia.


3. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐτελεύτησε Δαρεῖος καὶ κατέστη εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀρταξέρξης,
Τισσαφέρνης διαβάλλει τὸν Κῦρον πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοι αὐτῷ.
ὁ δὲ πείθεται καὶ συλλαμβάνει Κῦρον ὡς ἀποκτενῶν·
ἡ δὲ μήτηρ ἐξαιτησαμένη αὐτὸν ἀποπέμπει πάλιν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχήν.

After Darius passed away and Artaxerces was appointed to the kingdom,
Tissaphernes denounced Cyrus to his brother,
accusing him of plotting against him.
Artaxerces was persuaded and arrested Cyrus, intending to kill him -
but his mother gained his pardon and sent him back to his province.


4. ὁ δ ̓ ὡς ἀπῆλθε κινδυνεύσας καὶ ἀτιμασθείς,
βουλεύεται ὅπως μήποτε ἔτι ἔσται ἐπὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ,
ἀλλά, ἢν δύνηται, βασιλεύσει ἀντ ̓ ἐκείνου.
Παρύσατις μὲν δὴ ἡ μήτηρ ὑπῆρχε τῷ Κύρῳ,
φιλοῦσα αὐτὸν μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν βασιλεύοντα Ἀρταξέρξην.

Now when he left, having been in danger and dishonor,
he thought on how to keep from being in his brother's power any more,
but that, if he could, he would rule over him.
Certainly, his mother Parysatis was devoted to Cyrus, loving him more
than the ruler Artaxerces.


5. ὅστις δ ̓ ἀφικνεῖτο τῶν παρὰ βασιλέως πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντας
οὕτω διατιθεὶς ἀπεπέμπετο ὥστε αὐτῷ μᾶλλον φίλους εἶναι ἢ βασιλεῖ.
καὶ τῶν παρ ̓ ἑαυτῷ δὲ βαρβάρων ἐπεμελεῖτο ὡς πολεμεῖν τε ἱκανοὶ εἴησαν καὶ
εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχοιεν αὐτῷ.

And when anyone came to him from the king,
he was treated in such a way that when he left
he was a better friend to Cyrus than to the king.
He also took care that the barbarians at his side
would be capable warriors and feel favorably towards him.


6. τὴν δὲ Ἑλληνικὴν δύναμιν ἥθροιζεν ὡς μάλιστα ἐδύνατο ἐπικρυπτόμενος,
ὅπως ὅτι ἀπαρασκευότατον λάβοι βασιλέα.
ὧδε οὖν ἐποιεῖτο τὴν συλλογήν.
ὁπόσας εἶχε φυλακὰς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι παρήγγειλε τοῖς φρουράρχοις ἑκάστοις
λαμβάνειν ἄνδρας Πελοποννησίους ὅτι πλείστους καὶ βελτίστους,
ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοντος Τισσαφέρνους ταῖς πόλεσι.
καὶ γὰρ ἦσαν αἱ Ἰωνικαὶ πόλεις Τισσαφέρνους τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἐκ βασιλέως δεδομέναι,
τότε δὲ ἀφειστήκεσαν πρὸς Κῦρον πᾶσαι πλὴν Μιλήτου·

Now he gathered his Greek forces as secretly as possible,
in order to take the king completely unawares.
He accomplished the muster in this way:
For each garrison in the cities that he held, he gave orders for the commander
to accept as many of the best Peloponnesian men as he could find,
on the grounds that Tissaphernes was plotting against the cities.
For the Ionian cities had been Tissaphernes' in the beginning,
as the king had given them to him,
but they had later revolted, all except Miletus, to Cyrus.


7. ἐν Μιλήτῳ δὲ Τισσαφέρνης προαισθόμενος τὰ αὐτὰ ταῦτα βουλευομένους
ἀποστῆναι πρὸς Κῦρον, τοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν ἀπέκτεινε τοὺς δ ̓ ἐξέβαλεν.
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὑπολαβὼν τοὺς φεύγοντας συλλέξας στράτευμα ἐπολιόρκει Μίλητον
καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλατταν καὶ ἐπειρᾶτο κατάγειν τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας.
καὶ αὕτη αὖ ἄλλη πρόφασις ἦν αὐτῷ τοῦ ἁθροίζειν στράτευμα.

In Miletus Tissaphernes learned that men were deliberating these same things -
revolting to Cyrus - and he slew some of them and cast others out.
Cyrus took the fugitives in and mustered an army, 
and laid siege to Miletus both by land and sea and
tried to lead back the men who'd been driven out.
And this was yet another pretext for him to gather an army.


8. πρὸς δὲ βασιλέα πέμπων ἠξίου ἀδελφὸς ὢν αὐτοῦ δοθῆναι οἷ ταύτας
τὰς πόλεις μᾶλλον ἢ Τισσαφέρνην ἄρχειν αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἡ μήτηρ συνέπραττεν αὐτῷ ταῦτα·
ὥστε βασιλεὺς τὴν μὲν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ἐπιβουλὴν οὐκ ᾐσθάνετο,
Τισσαφέρνει δ ̓ ἐνόμιζε πολεμοῦντα αὐτὸν ἀμφὶ τὰ στρατεύματα δαπανᾶν·
ὥστε οὐδὲν ἤχθετο αὐτῶν πολεμούντων.
καὶ γὰρ ὁ Κῦρος ἀπέπεμπε τοὺς γιγνομένους δασμοὺς βασιλεῖ
ἐκ τῶν πόλεων ὧν Τισσαφέρνους ἐτύγχανεν ἔχων.

He sent to the king, requesting, as he was his brother,
that these cities be given to him rather than to Tissaphernes,
and his mother concurred in this.
As a result the king didn't perceive the plot against himself,
believing that he was spending on armies to go to war against Tissaphernes -
and he was mightily pleased to see them at war with each other.
And in fact, Cyrus sent the king regular tributes
from the cities of Tissaphernes that he happened to hold.
