I.1.
Δαρείου καὶ Παρυσάτιδος γίγνονται παῖδες δύο, πρεσβύτερος μὲν Ἀρταξέρξης,
νεώτερος δὲ Κῦρος· ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠσθένει Δαρεῖος καὶ ὑπώπτευε τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου,
ἐβούλετο τὼ παῖδε ἀμφοτέρω παρεῖναι.

To Darius and Parysatis were born two sons, the elder Artaxerxes,
and the younger Cyrus. Now when Darius was ill and felt his death near,
he wanted both children to be present.


2. ὁ μὲν οὖν πρεσβύτερος παρὼν ἐτύγχανε·
Κῦρον δὲ μεταπέμπεται ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἧς αὐτὸν σατράπην ἐποίησε,
καὶ στρατηγὸν δὲ αὐτὸν ἀπέδειξε πάντων ὅσοι ἐς Καστωλοῦ πεδίον ἁθροίζονται.
ἀναβαίνει οὖν ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν Τισσαφέρνην ὡς φίλον,
καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἔχων ὁπλίτας ἀνέβη τριακοσίους,
ἄρχοντα δὲ αὐτῶν Ξενίαν Παρράσιον.

Now the elder son happened to be at hand then,
but he sent for Cyrus from the region that he had made him satrap of,
and had also appointed him general of all those who muster at Castolus’ Plain.
Cyrus then embarked, taking along Tissaphernes as his friend,
and three hundred of the Greek hoplites and their commander Xenias of Parrhasia.


3. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐτελεύτησε Δαρεῖος καὶ κατέστη εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀρταξέρξης,
Τισσαφέρνης διαβάλλει τὸν Κῦρον πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοι αὐτῷ.
ὁ δὲ πείθεται καὶ συλλαμβάνει Κῦρον ὡς ἀποκτενῶν·
ἡ δὲ μήτηρ ἐξαιτησαμένη αὐτὸν ἀποπέμπει πάλιν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχήν.

After Darius passed away and Artaxerces was appointed to the kingdom,
Tissaphernes denounced Cyrus to his brother,
accusing him of plotting against him.
Artaxerces was persuaded and arrested Cyrus, intending to kill him -
but his mother gained his pardon and sent him back to his province.


4. ὁ δ ̓ ὡς ἀπῆλθε κινδυνεύσας καὶ ἀτιμασθείς,
βουλεύεται ὅπως μήποτε ἔτι ἔσται ἐπὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ,
ἀλλά, ἢν δύνηται, βασιλεύσει ἀντ ̓ ἐκείνου.
Παρύσατις μὲν δὴ ἡ μήτηρ ὑπῆρχε τῷ Κύρῳ,
φιλοῦσα αὐτὸν μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν βασιλεύοντα Ἀρταξέρξην.

Now when he left, having been in danger and dishonor,
he thought on how to keep from being in his brother's power any more,
but that, if he could, he would rule over him.
Certainly, his mother Parysatis was devoted to Cyrus, loving him more
than the ruler Artaxerces.


5. ὅστις δ ̓ ἀφικνεῖτο τῶν παρὰ βασιλέως πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντας
οὕτω διατιθεὶς ἀπεπέμπετο ὥστε αὐτῷ μᾶλλον φίλους εἶναι ἢ βασιλεῖ.
καὶ τῶν παρ ̓ ἑαυτῷ δὲ βαρβάρων ἐπεμελεῖτο ὡς πολεμεῖν τε ἱκανοὶ εἴησαν καὶ
εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχοιεν αὐτῷ.

And when anyone from the king came to him,
he treated him as such a way so that when he left
he was more of a friend to him than to the king.
And he took care of the barbarians at his side,
so that they'd be capable warriors and feel favorably towards him.


6. τὴν δὲ Ἑλληνικὴν δύναμιν ἥθροιζεν ὡς μάλιστα ἐδύνατο ἐπικρυπτόμενος,
ὅπως ὅτι ἀπαρασκευότατον λάβοι βασιλέα.
ὧδε οὖν ἐποιεῖτο τὴν συλλογήν.
ὁπόσας εἶχε φυλακὰς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι παρήγγειλε τοῖς φρουράρχοις ἑκάστοις
λαμβάνειν ἄνδρας Πελοποννησίους ὅτι πλείστους καὶ βελτίστους,
ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοντος Τισσαφέρνους ταῖς πόλεσι.
καὶ γὰρ ἦσαν αἱ Ἰωνικαὶ πόλεις Τισσαφέρνους τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἐκ βασιλέως δεδομέναι,
τότε δὲ ἀφειστήκεσαν πρὸς Κῦρον πᾶσαι πλὴν Μιλήτου·

Now he was gathering his Greek forces as secretly as he could,
in order to take the king completely unawares.
In fact he was accomplishing the muster in this wise.
As many guards as he had in the cities he passed on to each of the commanders
to take the largest and best Peloponnesian men,
on the grounds that of plotting Tissaphernes to the cities.
And for the Ionian women were to cities of Tissaphernes >the beginning from the
king having been given,
they had then revolted towards Cyrus all except Miletus.


7. ἐν Μιλήτῳ
δὲ Τισσαφέρνης προαισθόμενος τὰ αὐτὰ ταῦτα βουλευομένους
ἀποστῆναι πρὸς Κῦρον, τοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν ἀπέκτεινε τοὺς δ ̓
ἐξέβαλεν. ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὑπολαβὼν τοὺς φεύγοντας συλλέξας
15
στράτευμα ἐπολιόρκει Μίλητον καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θά-
λατταν καὶ ἐπειρᾶτο κατάγειν τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας. καὶ αὕτη
αὖ ἄλλη πρόφασις ἦν αὐτῷ τοῦ ἁθροίζειν στράτευμα. 8. πρὸς
δὲ βασιλέα πέμπων ἠξίου ἀδελφὸς ὢν αὐτοῦ δοθῆναι οἷ ταύτας
τὰς πόλεις μᾶλλον ἢ Τισσαφέρνην ἄρχειν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἡ μήτηρ
