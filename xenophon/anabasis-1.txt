I.1
Δαρείου καὶ Παρυσάτιδος γίγνονται παῖδες δύο, πρεσβύτερος μὲν Ἀρταξέρξης,
νεώτερος δὲ Κῦρος· ἐπεὶ δὲ ἠσθένει Δαρεῖος καὶ ὑπώπτευε τελευτὴν τοῦ βίου,
ἐβούλετο τὼ παῖδε ἀμφοτέρω παρεῖναι.

To Darius and Parysatis were born two sons, the elder Artaxerxes,
and the younger Cyrus. Now when Darius was ill and felt his death near,
he wanted both children to be present.


I.2. ὁ μὲν οὖν πρεσβύτερος παρὼν ἐτύγχανε·
Κῦρον δὲ μεταπέμπεται ἀπὸ τῆς ἀρχῆς ἧς αὐτὸν σατράπην ἐποίησε,
καὶ στρατηγὸν δὲ αὐτὸν ἀπέδειξε πάντων ὅσοι ἐς Καστωλοῦ πεδίον ἁθροίζονται.
ἀναβαίνει οὖν ὁ Κῦρος λαβὼν Τισσαφέρνην ὡς φίλον,
καὶ τῶν Ἑλλήνων ἔχων ὁπλίτας ἀνέβη τριακοσίους,
ἄρχοντα δὲ αὐτῶν Ξενίαν Παρράσιον.

Now the elder son happened to be at hand then,
but he sent for Cyrus from the region that he had made him satrap of,
and had also appointed him general of all those who muster at Castolus’ Plain.
Cyrus then embarked, taking along Tissaphernes as his friend,
and three hundred of the Greek hoplites and their commander Xenias of Parrhasia.


I.3. ἐπεὶ δὲ ἐτελεύτησε Δαρεῖος καὶ κατέστη εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν Ἀρταξέρξης,
Τισσαφέρνης διαβάλλει τὸν Κῦρον πρὸς τὸν ἀδελφὸν ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοι αὐτῷ.
ὁ δὲ πείθεται καὶ συλλαμβάνει Κῦρον ὡς ἀποκτενῶν·
ἡ δὲ μήτηρ ἐξαιτησαμένη αὐτὸν ἀποπέμπει πάλιν ἐπὶ τὴν ἀρχήν.

After Darius passed away and Artaxerces was appointed to the kingdom,
Tissaphernes denounced Cyrus to his brother,
accusing him of plotting against him.
Artaxerces was persuaded and arrested Cyrus, intending to kill him -
but his mother gained his pardon and sent him back to his province.


I.4. ὁ δ ̓ ὡς ἀπῆλθε κινδυνεύσας καὶ ἀτιμασθείς,
βουλεύεται ὅπως μήποτε ἔτι ἔσται ἐπὶ τῷ ἀδελφῷ,
ἀλλά, ἢν δύνηται, βασιλεύσει ἀντ ̓ ἐκείνου.
Παρύσατις μὲν δὴ ἡ μήτηρ ὑπῆρχε τῷ Κύρῳ,
φιλοῦσα αὐτὸν μᾶλλον ἢ τὸν βασιλεύοντα Ἀρταξέρξην.

Now when he left, having been in danger and dishonor,
he thought on how to keep from being in his brother's power any more,
but that, if he could, he would rule over him.
Certainly, his mother Parysatis was devoted to Cyrus, loving him more
than the ruler Artaxerces.


5. ὅστις δ ̓ ἀφικνεῖτο τῶν παρὰ βασιλέως πρὸς αὐτὸν πάντας
οὕτω διατιθεὶς ἀπεπέμπετο ὥστε αὐτῷ μᾶλλον φίλους εἶναι ἢ βασιλεῖ.
καὶ τῶν παρ ̓ ἑαυτῷ δὲ βαρβάρων ἐπεμελεῖτο ὡς πολεμεῖν τε ἱκανοὶ εἴησαν καὶ
εὐνοϊκῶς ἔχοιεν αὐτῷ.

And when anyone came to him from the king,
he was treated in such a way that when he left
he was a better friend to Cyrus than to the king.
He also took care that the barbarians at his side
would be capable warriors and feel favorably towards him.


I.6. τὴν δὲ Ἑλληνικὴν δύναμιν ἥθροιζεν ὡς μάλιστα ἐδύνατο ἐπικρυπτόμενος,
ὅπως ὅτι ἀπαρασκευότατον λάβοι βασιλέα.
ὧδε οὖν ἐποιεῖτο τὴν συλλογήν.
ὁπόσας εἶχε φυλακὰς ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι παρήγγειλε τοῖς φρουράρχοις ἑκάστοις
λαμβάνειν ἄνδρας Πελοποννησίους ὅτι πλείστους καὶ βελτίστους,
ὡς ἐπιβουλεύοντος Τισσαφέρνους ταῖς πόλεσι.
καὶ γὰρ ἦσαν αἱ Ἰωνικαὶ πόλεις Τισσαφέρνους τὸ ἀρχαῖον ἐκ βασιλέως δεδομέναι,
τότε δὲ ἀφειστήκεσαν πρὸς Κῦρον πᾶσαι πλὴν Μιλήτου·

Now he gathered his Greek forces as secretly as possible,
in order to take the king completely unawares.
He accomplished the muster in this way:
For each garrison in the cities that he held, he gave orders for the commander
to accept as many of the best Peloponnesian men as he could find,
on the grounds that Tissaphernes was plotting against the cities.
For the Ionian cities had been Tissaphernes' in the beginning,
as the king had given them to him,
but they had later revolted, all except Miletus, to Cyrus.


I.7. ἐν Μιλήτῳ δὲ Τισσαφέρνης προαισθόμενος τὰ αὐτὰ ταῦτα βουλευομένους
ἀποστῆναι πρὸς Κῦρον, τοὺς μὲν αὐτῶν ἀπέκτεινε τοὺς δ ̓ ἐξέβαλεν.
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος ὑπολαβὼν τοὺς φεύγοντας συλλέξας στράτευμα ἐπολιόρκει Μίλητον
καὶ κατὰ γῆν καὶ κατὰ θάλατταν καὶ ἐπειρᾶτο κατάγειν τοὺς ἐκπεπτωκότας.
καὶ αὕτη αὖ ἄλλη πρόφασις ἦν αὐτῷ τοῦ ἁθροίζειν στράτευμα.

Tissaphernes learned that the men in Miletus were planning the same thing -
revolting to Cyrus - and he slew some of them and exiled others.
Cyrus took the fugitives in and mustered an army, 
and laid siege to Miletus both by land and sea and
tried to restore the city to the exiles.
And this was yet another pretext for him to gather an army.


I.8. πρὸς δὲ βασιλέα πέμπων ἠξίου ἀδελφὸς ὢν αὐτοῦ δοθῆναι οἷ ταύτας
τὰς πόλεις μᾶλλον ἢ Τισσαφέρνην ἄρχειν αὐτῶν,
καὶ ἡ μήτηρ συνέπραττεν αὐτῷ ταῦτα·
ὥστε βασιλεὺς τὴν μὲν πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ἐπιβουλὴν οὐκ ᾐσθάνετο,
Τισσαφέρνει δ ̓ ἐνόμιζε πολεμοῦντα αὐτὸν ἀμφὶ τὰ στρατεύματα δαπανᾶν·
ὥστε οὐδὲν ἤχθετο αὐτῶν πολεμούντων.
καὶ γὰρ ὁ Κῦρος ἀπέπεμπε τοὺς γιγνομένους δασμοὺς βασιλεῖ
ἐκ τῶν πόλεων ὧν Τισσαφέρνους ἐτύγχανεν ἔχων.

He sent to the king, requesting, as he was his brother,
that these cities be given to him rather than to Tissaphernes,
and his mother concurred in this.
As a result the king didn't perceive the plot against himself,
believing that he was spending on armies to go to war against Tissaphernes -
and he was mightily pleased to see them at war with each other.
And in fact, Cyrus sent the king regular tributes
from the cities of Tissaphernes that he happened to hold.


I.9. ἄλλο δὲ στράτευμα αὐτῷ συνελέγετο ἐν Χερρονήσῳ
τῇ κατ̓ ἀντιπέρας Ἀβύδου τόνδε τὸν τρόπον.
Κλέαρχος Λακεδαιμόνιος φυγὰς ἦν· τούτῳ συγγενόμενος ὁ
Κῦρος ἠγάσθη τε αὐτὸν καὶ δίδωσιν αὐτῷ μυρίους δαρεικούς.
ὁ δὲ λαβὼν τὸ χρυσίον στράτευμα συνέλεξεν ἀπὸ τούτων τῶν
χρημάτων καὶ ἐπολέμει ἐκ Χερρονήσου ὁρμώμενος τοῖς Θρᾳξὶ
τοῖς ὑπὲρ Ἑλλήσποντον οἰκοῦσι καὶ ὠφέλει τοὺς Ἕλληνας·
ὥστε καὶ χρήματα συνεβάλλοντο αὐτῷ εἰς τὴν τροφὴν τῶν
στρατιωτῶν αἱ Ἑλλησποντιακαὶ πόλεις ἑκοῦσαι.
τοῦτο δ ̓ αὖ οὕτω τρεφόμενον ἐλάνθανεν αὐτῷ τὸ στράτευμα.

Another army was being assembled for him, on the Chersonese
peninsula opposite Abydus, in this way.
Clearchus was an exile from Sparta: Cyrus was acquainted with him
and admired him, and gave him ten thousand gold coins.
And he took the gold and gathered an army with it,
and, to aid the Greeks, started a war from the Chersonese
with the Thracians that lived above the Hellespont.
In aid of this, the cities of the Hellespont also willingly
contributed money to him for the soldiers' rations.
And thus this fresh army was secretly maintained for him.


I.10. Ἀρίστιππος δὲ ὁ Θετταλὸς ξένος ὢν ἐτύγχανεν αὐτῷ,
καὶ πιεζόμενος ὑπὸ τῶν οἴκοι ἀντιστασιωτῶν ἔρχεται πρὸς τὸν Κῦρον
καὶ αἰτεῖ αὐτὸν εἰς δισχιλίους ξένους καὶ τριῶν μηνῶν μισθόν,
ὡς οὕτως περιγενόμενος ἂν τῶν ἀντιστασιωτῶν.
ὁ δὲ Κῦρος δίδωσιν αὐτῷ εἰς τετρακισχιλίους καὶ ἓξ μηνῶν μισθόν,
καὶ δεῖται αὐτοῦ μὴ πρόσθεν καταλῦσαι πρὸς τοὺς ἀντιστασιώτας
πρὶν ἂν αὐτῷ συμβουλεύσηται.
οὕτω δὲ αὖ τὸ ἐν Θετταλίᾳ ἐλάνθανεν αὐτῷ τρεφόμενον στράτευμα.

Aristippus the Thessalian - a friend of his -
was under pressure at home from an opposition party.
He went to Cyrus and asked him for wages for two thousand mercenaries for
three months, in order to prevail over that faction.
And Cyrus gave him six months wages for four thousand,
and asked that he not destroy the opposition
until he had a chance to consult with him.
And so another army was built up for him in Thessaly without being noticed.


I.11. Πρόξενον δὲ τὸν Βοιώτιον ξένον ὄντα ἐκέλευσε λαβόντα ἄνδρας
ὅτι πλείστους παραγενέσθαι, ὡς ἐς Πισίδας βουλόμενος στρατεύεσθαι,
ὡς πράγματα παρεχόντων τῶν Πισιδῶν τῇ ἑαυτοῦ χώρᾳ.
Σοφαίνετον δὲ τὸν Στυμφάλιον καὶ Σωκράτην τὸν Ἀχαιόν,
ξένους ὄντας καὶ τούτους, ἐκέλευσεν ἄνδρας λαβόντας ἐλθεῖν ὅτι πλείστους,
ὡς πολεμήσων Τισσαφέρνει σὺν τοῖς φυγάσι τοῖς Μιλησίων.
καὶ ἐποίουν οὕτως οὗτοι.

He urged Proxenus the Boeotian, a friend of his,
to come bringing as many men as he could,
as if he wished to march into Pisidia,
seeing that the Pisidians were causing trouble for his province.
He urged Sophaenetus the Stymphalian and Socrates the Achaian,
who were also friends of his, to march with as many men as they could
as if to fight Tissaphernes, along with the Milesian exiles.
And they acted in this manner.


II.1. ἐπεὶ δ ̓ ἐδόκει ἤδη πορεύεσθαι αὐτῷ ἄνω, τὴν μὲν πρόφασιν ἐποιεῖτο
ὡς Πισίδας βουλόμενος ἐκβαλεῖν παντάπασιν ἐκ τῆς χώρας·
καὶ ἁθροίζει ὡς ἐπὶ τούτους τό τε βαρβαρικὸν καὶ τὸ Ἑλληνικόν.
ἐνταῦθα καὶ παραγγέλλει τῷ τε Κλεάρχῳ λαβόντι ἥκειν ὅσον
ἦν αὐτῷ στράτευμα καὶ τῷ Ἀριστίππῳ συναλλαγέντι πρὸς
τοὺς οἴκοι ἀποπέμψαι πρὸς ἑαυτὸν ὃ εἶχε στράτευμα·
καὶ Ξενίᾳ τῷ Ἀρκάδι, ὃς αὐτῷ προειστήκει τοῦ ἐν ταῖς πόλεσι ξενικοῦ,
ἥκειν παραγγέλλει λαβόντα τοὺς ἄλλους πλὴν ὁπόσοι ἱκανοὶ ἦσαν
τὰς ἀκροπόλεις φυλάττειν.
ἐκάλεσε δὲ καὶ τοὺς Μίλητον πολιορκοῦντας,

When it seemed a good time for him to march inland,
he claimed that he wanted to totally expel the Pisidians from the country,
and mustered both his barbarian and Greek armies as if against them.
He also sent orders to Clearchus to come there with as large an army as he
could, and to Aristippus to reconcile with his enemies at home
and send him however large an army that he had:
and he commanded Xenias the Arkadian,
who was in charge of the foreign army in the cities,
to leave only enough men to defend the citadels and sail to him with the rest.
He also summoned the men who were besieging Miletus


II.2. καὶ τοὺς φυγάδας ἐκέλευσε σὺν αὐτῷ στρατεύεσθαι,
ὑποσχόμενος αὐτοῖς, εἰ καλῶς καταπράξειεν ἐφ ̓ ἃ ἐστρατεύετο,
μὴ πρόσθεν παύσεσθαι πρὶν αὐτοὺς καταγάγοι οἴκαδε.
οἱ δὲ ἡδέως ἐπείθοντο· ἐπίστευον γὰρ αὐτῷ·
καὶ λαβόντες τὰ ὅπλα παρῆσαν εἰς Σάρδεις.

and ordered the exiles to advance with him,
promising them that if he accomplished what he had set out to do,
he would not rest until he had led them back home.
And they happily agreed, for they trusted him,
and took up arms and readied themselves at Sardis.
